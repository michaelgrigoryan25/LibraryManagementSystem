He introduces us to the major thinkers, texts, and historical periods of Western philosophy, recounting many of the stories philosophers have used over time to engage with issues of philosophical concern: questions of meaning, truth, knowledge, value, action, and ethics. Rescher’s anecdotes touch on a wide range of themes—from logic to epistemology, ethics to metaphysics—and offer much insight into the breadth and depth of philosophical inquiry. This book illustrates the various ways philosophers throughout history have viewed the issues in their field, and how anecdotes can work to inform and encourage philosophical thought.",

    "subtitle": "Including Its Application to Safety-Related Systems",
    "description": "The rapid growth in use of programmable technology, in nearly all sectors of Engineering, is a well-known established trend and one which there is every reason to believe will continue into the foreseeable future. The drivers of this trend include cost, flexibility, rich functionality and certain reliability and safety advantages. However, as explained in this book, these advantages have to be carefully weighed against a number of dis advantages which, amongst other things, have fundamental implications for reliability and safety. Ideally, a programmable system would be viewed as a fusion of hardware, software and user (or \u0027skinware\u0027), operating under a set of environmental conditions. To date, such a unifying model does not exist and so hardware, software and human factors are still considered largely as three separate disciplines, albeit with certain interdependencies. Established techniques are available which enable the engineer to develop systems comprising purely hardware components to a prescribed reliability and performance. Software, however, is fundamentally different in a number of ways, and does not lend itself to equivalent analysis. A major problem with software is its poor \u0027visibility\u0027, and consequently the great difficulty in understanding and predicting its behaviour in all cir cumstances. This results in the ever-present software design flaws, or \u0027bugs\u0027, which have plagued the software industry from its beginnings.",

    "description": "Armenia Travel Guide. Armenia Information. It might be a small nation, but Armenia is big on character. Its 20th century history was troubled and relations with neighbouring Turkey are still fractious to put it mildly although a visit to the country today is more likely to be dominated by its medieval treasures than its more recent past. The welcome is rarely anything less than warm and usually accompanied by brandy and the countryside itself is often breathtakingly beautiful. Tourist numbers are generally low, but you\u0027ll find yourself wondering why. This is a country with serious historical legacy. Christianity arrived in AD 301 and Armenia proudly calls itself the world\u0027s oldest Christian nation. Religion still tends to play a large part in visitor itineraries from the centuries-old monasteries that stud the hilly Lori region to the mists-of-time bibles at the wonderful Museum of Ancient Manuscripts but Armenia is changing. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the country has re-embraced its traditions while moving on. Much of this progress is focused on the capital city of Yerevan. Loomed over on clear days by Mount Ararat across the border, it is the nation\u0027s hub of cultural activity and progressive thought, with a lively modern arts scene and plenty of large-scale redevelopment. Armenia has a large diaspora population there are thousands of Armenian Americans and a lot of wealth has been brought back into the country as a result. But the passions that underpin life here, from patriotism to religion, chess to cognac, aren\u0027t the sort that cost millions. Cafe culture has been perfected and it\u0027s de rigueur to spend inordinate amounts of time lingering over a conversation. Armenian food is another treat expect mounds of grilled meats and vegetables straight from the nearest garden. Around the country, travel highlights include the charming little town of Goris and the arty mountain settlement of Dilijan, but exploration anywhere in Armenia is likely to reap rewards.",

    "description": "Excerpt from Armenia and Her People: Or the Story of Armenia by an Armenian I was born January 20, 1853, in a suburb of Antioch; twelfth child and youngest son of a family of nine boys and four girls, and therefore considered the Joseph of the fam ily, and as a small boy went to a missionary school with my elder brothers. My father was a banker and merchant. His partner in the former business was Mr. Edward Barker, English consul at Aleppo; in the latter a Greek, Jabra An taki, their trafiic being in raw silk, for which and for silk worms Antioch is a great center. Millions of dollars passed through his hands, and he was considered one Of the wealth iest men in the city. A common saying was, If you can drain the Mediterranean dry, you can drain Filian\u0027s money dry. This saying roused the cupidity of the local governor; he imprisoned my father, and proposed to torture and kill him, and confiscate his property. Americans would relish living under this sort of government. His partner, the consul, saved him, however, and won his undying gratitude; and when Mr. Barker died, my father gave his son a part of his own orchard for a burial ground. The son erected a beautiful monument there, which still stands, the ground being owned by my brother, Moses Filian. When I was fourteen or fifteen, my father lost all his money through the failure of others became hopelessly bankrupt, and was too Old to regain hls position, and sank into a poor and broken-hearted Old man: his Mediterranean was not inexhaustible. He Often patted me and said, My dear boy, I am sorry - I helped your brothers and gave them good educations, and I meant to do the same by you; but I cannot, for I am too poor. You will have to make your own way. He was a devoted friend Of education. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

    "subtitle": "The Yerevan Province, 1900-1914",
    "description": "This book seeks, for the first time, to examine the demography and the social and economic conditions in the Yerevan Province during the first decade of the twentieth century, before the great changes that occurred during World War I and the seven decades of Soviet rule. Unlike in Tiflis and Baku, the Armenian inhabitants of the Yerevan Province were overwhelmingly peasants. They did not play a major role in the political, intellectual or economic life of the South Caucasus. The aim of the book is to prove conclusively that the Armenians of the Yerevan Province not only benefited from living under the umbrella of imperial security, but, as junior and senior officials, they also acquired important administrative and professional skills. The social and economic changes of the last decade of Russian rule enabled the local Armenians to advance and, following the collapse of the Russian Empire, to occupy posts previously held by Russians. Thus, despite the absence of their most talented individuals and the lack of experienced political leaders, as well as the loss of half their territory to Turkish attacks in 1918, the local Armenian administration, in the face of terrible conditions and great odds, provided the foundation which allowed the Armenian Republic to maintain its independence until December of 1920. In fact, some of the survivors would assist in the modernization and nation building of Soviet Armenia. Providing a detailed overview of the history of the Yerevan Province in the late imperial age, this book will be a valuable resource for students and scholars interested in the History of Armenia, the Russian Empire and the Caucasus.",

    "description": "This work represents the first systematic study of Armenia’s foreign policy during the post-independence period, between 1991 and 2005. It explores four sets of relationships with Armenia’s major historical ‘partners’: Russia, Iran, Turkey and the West (Europe and the United States). Each relationship reveals a complex reality of a continuous negotiation between ideas of history, collective memory, nationalism and geopolitics. As a result, an important conclusion of this work is that an analysis of a small state’s foreign policy is best captured by looking at regional dynamics rather than more structural approaches to international politics. For Armenia, this book argues that although its foreign policy has been severely constrained, it was nonetheless adept at carving a space for action that privileged the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh over other geopolitical imperatives.",

    "description": "Given the impact that successive court rulings have had on the organisation of the sports movement in the past 15 years, the autonomy of non-governmental sports organisations has become a highly topical concern in Europe. It is also closely related to the issue of governance, the subject of previous Council of Europe studies. The Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport (EPAS) decided to explore the concept of autonomy in greater depth by studying the conceptual, political, legal, economic and psycho-sociological aspects of the subject. This study was carried out at the request of the EPAS by the Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration (IDHEAP) on the basis of a questionnaire sent to public authorities in charge of sport and to national and international umbrella sports organisations. In addition to an analysis of the data obtained, documents produced by public authorities and sports organisations on this emerging issue are presented. This study contributes to a better understanding of the concept of autonomy and offers a clear picture of the issues involved.",

In Beyond: The Philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, Adriaan Theodoor Peperzak shows Levinas\u0027s thought to be a persistent attempt to point beyond the borders of an economy where orderly interests and ways of reasoning make us feel at home--beyond the world of needs, beyond the self, beyond politics and administration, beyond logic and ontology, even beyond freedom and autonomy. Peperzak\u0027s examination begins with a general overview of Levinas\u0027s life and thought, and shows how issues of ethics, politics, and religion are intertwined in Levinas\u0027s philosophy. Peperzak also discusses the development of Levinas\u0027s relations with Husserl and Heidegger, demonstrating thematically the evolution of both Levinas\u0027s anti-Heideggerian view of technology and his critical attitude toward nature.",

    "description": "Even the best Wall Street investors make mistakes. No matter how savvy or experienced, all financial practitioners eventually let bias, overconfidence, and emotion cloud their judgement and misguide their actions. Yet most financial decision-making models fail to factor in these fundamentals of human nature. In Beyond Greed and Fear, the most authoritative guide to what really influences the decision-making process, Hersh Shefrin uses the latest psychological research to help us understand the human behavior that guides stock selection, financial services, and corporate financial strategy. Shefrin argues that financial practitioners must acknowledge and understand behavioral finance--the application of psychology to financial behavior--in order to avoid many of the investment pitfalls caused by human error. Through colorful, often humorous real-world examples, Shefrin points out the common but costly mistakes that money managers, security analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, and corporate leaders make, so that readers gain valuable insights into their own financial decisions and those of their employees, asset managers, and advisors. According to Shefrin, the financial community ignores the psychology of investing at its own peril. Beyond Greed and Fear illuminates behavioral finance for today\u0027s investor. It will help practitioners to recognize--and avoid--bias and errors in their decisions, and to modify and improve their overall investment strategies.",

    "description": "Roberta J. Newman and Joel Nathan Rosen have written an authoritative social history of the Negro Leagues. This book examines how the relationship between black baseball and black businesses functioned, particularly in urban areas with significant African American populations—Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, and more. Inextricably bound together by circumstance, these sports and business alliances faced destruction and upheaval. Once Jackie Robinson and a select handful of black baseball’s elite gained acceptance in Major League Baseball and financial stability in the mainstream economy, shock waves traveled throughout the black business world. Though the economic impact on Negro League baseball is perhaps obvious due to its demise, the impact on other black-owned businesses and on segregated neighborhoods is often undervalued if not outright ignored in current accounts. There have been many books written on great individual players who played in the Negro Leagues and/or integrated the Major Leagues. But Newman and Rosen move beyond hagiography to analyze what happens when a community has its economic footing undermined while simultaneously being called upon to celebrate a larger social progress. In this regard, Black Baseball, Black Business moves beyond the diamond to explore baseball’s desegregation narrative in a critical and wide ranging fashion.",

Such dialog will also acquaint researchers in each area with significant recent advances in the other area, and will enable a cross fertilization of thoughts, from which both can significantly benefit. This consolidates the efforts to bridge the gap between finance and accounting by looking at diverse topics in accounting and finance and providing interesting points of view on different topics. Most of the chapters concentrate on the topic of fair value accounting and on the question of the extent to which accounting reflects the financial situation of a firm.

    "description": "Business Models for Sustainability breaks new ground by combining three important insights. First, achieving sustainability requires socio-technical transitions that entail new technologies, production processes, lifestyles, and consumption patterns. Second, firms play crucial roles in mediating between sustainable production and consumption. Third, radical innovations require organizational innovations and new business models. Peter Wells successfully combines these big picture ideas with rich in-depth case studies drawing on years of accumulated expertise. Highly recommended. Frank W. Geels, University of Manchester, UK and Chairman of the Sustainability Transitions Research Network With increasing awareness that innovative technology alone is insufficient to make sustainable lifestyles a reality, this book brings into sharp focus the need to create radical new business models. This insightful book provides a theoretically grounded but also realistic account of how the design of business models can be a critical component in the overall transition to sustainability, and one that transcends the usual focus on innovative technology. Weaving together key principles and components for business sustainability, the book highlights five very different pathways to the future for sectors ranging from microbreweries and printing through to clothing, mobility and plastics. Business has only just started the first few tentative steps towards a very different approach to creating and sustaining value, but this book concludes that enormous opportunities will emerge alongside new ways of creating and capturing value. Academics and postgraduate students in the fields of sustainable business, business organisations and industrial ecology will find this book brings a greater understanding of business strategy and structure to the discipline. While traditionally referenced and structured, this academic book is accessibly written with key principles that may also appeal to the consultant community.",

    "description": "The Second Edition of this bestselling B2B marketing textbook offers the same accessible clarity of insight, combined with updated and engaging examples. Each chapter contains a detailed case study to further engage the reader with the topics examined. - Featuring updated case studies and a range of new examples. - Incorporating additional coverage of B2B branding and the B2B strategic marketing process, and issues of sustainability. - Extended coverage of Key Account Management - Online lecturer support including PowerPoint slides and key web links Drawing on their substantial experience of business-to-business marketing as practitioners, researchers and educators, the authors make this exciting and challenging area accessible to advanced undergraduate and to postgraduate students of marketing, management and business studies. Praise for the Second Edition: \u0027I found that the first edition of Brennan, Canning and McDowell\u0027s text was excellent for raising students\u0027 awareness and understanding of the most important concepts and phenomena associated with B2B marketing. The second edition should prove even more successful by using several new case studies and short \u0027snapshots\u0027 to illustrate possible solutions to common B2B marketing dilemmas, such as the design and delivery of business products and services, the selection of promotional tools and alternative routes to market. The new edition also deals clearly with complex issues such as inter-firm relationships and networks, e-B2B, logistics, supply chain management and B2B branding\u0027 - Michael Saren, Professor of Marketing, University of Leicester \u0027This textbook makes a unique contribution to business-to-business teaching: not only does it provide up-to-date cases and issues for discussion that reach to the heart of business-to-business marketing; it also brings in the latest academic debates and makes them both relevant and accessible to the readers. A fantastic addition to any library or course\u0027 - Dr Judy Zolkiewski, Senior Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Manchester Business School \u0027The advantage of the approach taken by Brennan and his colleagues is that this book manages to convey both the typical North American view of B2B marketing as the optimisation of a set of marketing mix variables, and the more emergent European view of B2B Marketing as being focused on the management of relationships between companies. This updated second edition sees the addition of a number of \u0027snapshots\u0027 in each chapter that bring the subject alive through the description of current examples, as well as some more expansive end-of-chapter case studies. It is truly a most welcome addition to the bookshelves of those students and faculty interested in this facet of marketing\u0027 - Peter Naudé, Professor of Marketing, Manchester Business School \u0027The strength of this text lies in the interconnection of academic theory with real world examples. Special attention has been given to the role that relationships play within the Business-to business environment, linking these to key concepts such as segmentation, targeting and marketing communications, which importantly encompasses the role personal selling as relationshipmmunications building and not just order taking. With good coverage of international cultural differences this is a valuable resource for both students of marketing and sales\u0027 - Andrew Whalley, Lecturer in Business-to-Business Marketing, Royal Holloway University of London \u0027The text provides an authoritative, up-to-date review of organisational strategy development and \u0027firmographic\u0027 market segmentation. It provides a comprehensive literature review and empiric examples through a range of relevant case studies. The approach to strategy formulation, ethics and corporate social responsibility are especially strong\u0027 - Stuart Challinor, Lecturer in Marketing, Newcastle University \u0027This revised second edition offers an excellent contemporary view of Business-to-Business Marketing. Refreshingly, the text is packed with an eclectic mix of largely European case studies that make for extremely interesting reading. It is a \u0027must read\u0027 for any undergraduate or postgraduate Marketing student\u0027 - Dr Jonathan Wilson, Senior Lecturer, Ashcroft International Business School, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge",

    "description": "An examination of software practice in Brazil that reveals both the globalization and the localization of software development. Software development would seem to be a quintessential example of today\u0027s Internet-enabled “knowledge work”—a global profession not bound by the constraints of geography. In Coding Places, Yuri Takhteyev looks at the work of software developers who inhabit two contexts: a geographical area—in this case, greater Rio de Janeiro—and a “world of practice,” a global system of activities linked by shared meanings and joint practice. The work of the Brazilian developers, Takhteyev discovers, reveals a paradox of the world of software: it is both diffuse and sharply centralized. The world of software revolves around a handful of places—in particular, the San Francisco Bay area—that exercise substantial control over both the material and cultural elements of software production. Takhteyev shows how in this context Brazilian software developers work to find their place in the world of software and to bring its benefits to their city. Takhteyev\u0027s study closely examines Lua, an open source programming language developed in Rio but used in such internationally popular products as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds. He shows that Lua had to be separated from its local origins on the periphery in order to achieve success abroad. The developers, Portuguese speakers, used English in much of their work on Lua. By bringing to light the work that peripheral practitioners must do to give software its seeming universality, Takhteyev offers a revealing perspective on the not-so-flat world of globalization.",

Well known arguments and problems from the history of philosophy are discussed and analyzed, not as a means to honor the dead or merely to discuss what various philosophers have thought, but to engage with, criticize, and even improve ideas from the past. In addition--because philosophy cannot function apart from its engagement with the wider society--traditional and contemporary philosophical problems are brought into dialogue with the physical, biological, and social sciences. Text boxes highlight key concepts, and review questions, discussion questions, and a glossary of terms are also included. Core Questions in Philosophy has served as a premier introductory textbook for more than two decades, with updates to each new edition. New improvements to this 7th Edition include a lower price and a new Routledge companion website that includes: Updated Supplementary Readings, with the inclusion of more work from female philosophers New videos and podcasts, organized by their relevance to each chapter in the book Visit the companion website at: www.routledge.com/cw/sober",

    "description": "Deconstruct the history of patterns of innovation in business and connect them to existing and failed attempts in management consultancies, engineering, web technologies and academic institutions. This book shows you how to create an optimal environment at work for growth and innovation. Many large-scale organizations eventually invest in research and innovation as a dedicated part of their businesses. In doing so, they are faced with two choices: build their own practice of innovation or enact patterns of innovation created before them, ones they perceived as \"tried and tested.\" In this book, you will see how patterns of innovation touch many aspects of a worker’s life: from how their work is presented to others, job titles, working environment, and expectations around output. Every chapter will offer a history of these patterns and examples of how they have succeeded and failed within organizations. What You Will Learn Identify how innovation is named and highlighted in organizations Reveal ways to champion innovation to clients and the outside world, from trade shows and conferences inside the office Uncover ways companies acquire innovation, including incubators or mergers Discover the conditions for innovation to happen every day, including office layouts, time management, communication structures, and expectation management Who This Book Is For Tech start-up/scale-up founders, management consultants, managing directors, innovation managers and heads of R\u0026D, academic researchers, interior designers, and architects",

    "description": "Why dissenters can be an organization\u0027s most valuable asset and how to transform dissent into innovation Innovation is essential to competitive survival in today\u0027s global marketplace. But in the majority of traditional organizations, innovators are perceived as counter-productive dissenters, single-minded troublemakers who are difficult to manage and politically naive. Written by a leading international expert on change management, this groundbreaking book explores the vital link between the need for innovation in the e-business world and the new role of dissenters as agents for constructive change. With the help of numerous case examples and anecdotes, Frances Horibe helps managers appreciate the value that dissent can bring to an organization, and she provides proven strategies and hands-on advice on how to encourage innovation and manage creative dissent, while avoiding paralyzing conflicts. Readers learn about the new role of managers as political handlers who help develop and support new ideas and sell them to senior management, and much more. Frances Horibe (Ottawa, Ontario) is President of VisionArts International, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in radical change management.",

It is with this realization, the Government of India, by announcing a number of policies and schemes, has been giving ever-increasing emphasis on developing creativity and innovation in entrepreneurship in the country. So much so, an increasing number of educational institutions in the country have started offering the paper on creativity and innovation in entrepreneurship in their course curricula. Because Creativity and Innovation in Entrepreneurship, as a subject, is relative of recent origin in India, there has so far not been any comprehensive textbook available on the subject in the Indian context.

There are other services in different sectors of the economy that can benefit from the trust and security that blockchains offer. For example, financial institutions are using blockchains for international money transfer, and in logistics, it has been used for supply chain management and tracking of goods. As more global companies and governments are experimenting and deploying blockchain solutions, it is necessary to compile knowledge on the best practices, strategies, and failures in order to create a better awareness of how blockchain could either support or add value to other services. Cross-Industry Use of Blockchain Technology and Opportunities for the Future provides emerging research highlighting the possibilities inherent in blockchain for different sectors of the economy and the added value blockchain can provide for the future of these different sectors. Featuring coverage on a broad range of topics such as data privacy, information sharing, and digital identity, this book is ideally designed for IT specialists, consultants, design engineers, cryptographers, service designers, researchers, academics, government officials, and industry professionals.",

    "subtitle": "New Thoughts, Empirical Research, Practical Reports",
    "description": "Cross-cultural means not only the differences between ethnic, racial or national groups. It is more. Cross-cultural confrontations arise by the differences of genders, educational levels, differences in thinking of diverse companies departments (e.g. production versus research \u0026 development, marketing versus finance), the mix of musicians or styles of painting. However, there is a lot of danger in cross-cultural collaboration: Diversity means different views, opinions, values and objectives easily generating misunderstandings and quarrels possibly ending up with serious conflicts. The conflicts may trigger new approaches and breakthroughs or lead to a state of frozen relations and stagnation. Sensitivity to the values and views of other cultures, open communication and aware leadership are traits helping to capitalize on cross-cultural influences. In further discussions with our friends of the EACI board we changed our mind for the new conference topic to CROSS-CULTURAL INNOVATION. Cross-cultural Innovations are new and origin problem solutions, which are generated in confronting problems with cross-cultural aspects. In many cases such solutions are breakthroughs and the start of a paradigm shift. Another advantage of such solutions is that they even influence the subconscious of stakeholders problems. Only cross-cultural solutions minimize the risk of hidden problems which develop under the surface in merger projects. Especially mergers of big companies are successful if change-managers are able to transfer cross-cultural conflicts in new challenging objectives. Bridging cultural gaps by visionary leadership is the way to bring people together and to create new common innovative enterprises or departments.\"",

As well as the complete text of the Meditations, the reader will find a thematic abridgement of the Objections and Replies (which were originally published with the Meditations) containing Descartes\u0027 replies to his critics. These extracts, specially selected for the present volume, indicate the main philosophical difficulties which occurred to Descartes\u0027 contemporaries and show how Descartes developed and clarified his arguments in response. This edition contains a new comprehensive introduction to Descartes\u0027 philosophy by John Cottingham and the classic introductory essay on the Meditations by Bernard Williams.",

And they need to be able to change those decisions immediately in order to adapt to this increasingly dynamic business environment. Whether it is a regulatory change in your industry, a new product introduction by a competitor that your organization needs to react to, or a new market opportunity that you want to quickly capture by changing your product pricing. Decisions like these lie at the heart of your organization\u0027s key business processes. In this IBM® RedpaperTM publication, we explore the benefits of identifying and documenting decisions within the context of your business processes. We describe a straightforward approach for doing this by using a business process and decision discovery tool called IBM Blueworks LiveTM, and we apply these techniques to a fictitious example from the auto insurance industry to help you better understand the concepts. This paper was written with a non-technical audience in mind. It is intended to help business users, subject matter experts, business analysts, and business managers get started discovering and documenting the decisions that are key to their company\u0027s business operations.",

Such methods include subsurface-engineered barriers, phytoremediation, and bioremediation. Nineteen manuscripts were selected for inclusion in this volume, based upon peer review, scientific merit, the editors\u0027 perceptions of lasting value or innovative features, and the general applicability of either the technology itself or the scientific methods and scholarly details provided by the authors.

Edited by renowned Olympic advisor, researcher, and teacher Yuri Hanin, the book provides you with -a comprehensive understanding of emotional patterns such as anxiety, anger, and joy, as well as their impact on individual and team performance; -solid methods for determining the optimal emotional state of individual athletes; -innovative strategies for avoiding overtraining, burnout, and fatigue, while helping enhance performance; -an overview of injury management and the positive emotional states that can actually accelerate the healing process; and -a long-overdue look at exercise, emotions, and mental health. Created and developed by Dr. Hanin during 30 years as a sport psychologist, the Individual Zones of Optimal Functioning (IZOF) model is the key conceptual framework in Emotions in Sport. The model can help you describe, predict, and explain the dynamics of emotion/performance for individual athletes and provides you with strategies for creating optimal emotional states and enhancing athletic performance. Appendixes to the volume include a reproducible IZOF model form and step-by-step data collection instructions for your use. Emotions in Sport incorporates the insights, wisdom, and experience of authorities worldwide to give you a new perspective on this important subject and its impact on athletes.",

The coverage of the work is broad in scope, moving from the Pre-Socratics to Postmodernism, critically assessing what transpired during the intervening 2500 year period, but with special attentiveness to the contributions of the Aristotelian/Thomistic tradition of inquiry. While each chapter can stand on its own, they collectively reveal a developing story that finds expression in diverse attempts to come to terms with what it means to be human, and how we understand ourselves as persons. This book is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of readers, from beginners to more advanced students.",

    "description": "“How can I create an innovation engine that will consistently deliver substantial organic growth?” This question is the number-one issue for most CEOs and senior executives today. Innovation is a critical driver of organic growth, yet based on the authors\u0027 research, only a small percent of companies effectively use innovation to sustain long-term, profitable growth. And the stakes couldn\u0027t be higher-failure to create successful new products, services, and business models causes stagnating or declining profits. Now, for the first time, experts Michael George, James Works and Kimberly Watson-Hemphill explain the surprising and significant gap between the CEO\u0027s growth goals and actual performance. The authors, who are experts at connecting strategy to execution, give you a complete blueprint for exploiting the strategic and operational dimensions of innovation. Using fresh insights about the true drivers of fast time-to-market and the inadequate success rate of innovation, Fast Innovation reveals: Why current approaches to innovation fail A new strategic and tactical plan that will help your company dramatically reduce time-to-market by 50 to 80 percent The secret for finding out what your customers really want (not just what they say they want) Tools and methods for turning customer insights into ideas that will generate significant ROI The key levers that senior leadership must engage to create innovation capability across the business You\u0027ll receive specific actionable solutions for driving disruptive and sustaining innovation at the strategic, portfolio and project level. You\u0027ll also learn how to improve how much time your innovation teams actually spend innovating, and discover the changes that must be launched at the corporate level in order to enable the whole business to embrace and get results from this approach.",

    "description": "The study examines empirical relationships between income inequality and three features of finance: depth (financial sector size relative to the economy), inclusion (access to and use of financial services by individuals and firms), and stability (absence of financial distress). Using new data covering a wide range of countries, the analysis finds that the financial sector can play a role in reducing inequality, complementing redistributive fiscal policy. By expanding the provision of financial services to low-income households and small businesses, it can serve as a powerful lever in helping create a more inclusive society but—if not well managed—it can amplify inequalities.",

Addressing an issue of central importance to the competitiveness of firms and economies, this book draws together research by leading academics in the area. Throughout, research studies develop the themes of market failure, finance gaps and failure of demand. They also bring out the linkages between the financing choices facing the growing firm and the issues of organisation and of corporate governance that have to be address during the process of growth and maturity. Contributors challenge financial orthodoxy throughout, providing coherent analyses of the difficulties faced in the finance of the growing enterprise, from its early dependence on banks and informal finance to the pinnacle of a stock exchange listing.",

    "description": "During the nineteenth century, much of the modern scientific enterprise took shape: scientific disciplines were formed, institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred. In this book, eleven leading historians of science assess what their field has taught us about this exciting time and identify issues that remain unexamined or require reconsideration. They treat both scientific disciplines—biology, physics, chemistry, the earth sciences, mathematics, and the social sciences—in their specific intellectual and sociocultural contexts as well as the broader topics of science and medicine; science and religion; scientific institutions and communities; and science, technology, and industry. Providing a much-needed overview and analysis of a rapidly expanding field, From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences will be essential for historians of science, but also of great interest to scholars of all aspects of nineteenth-century life and culture.

First, the focus is upon innovation in terms of commercialized products and processes and not on secondary indicators of research or patenting. Second, it combines academic perspectives with user perspectives from industry and international organizations. Third, it strikes a good balance between old and new indicators, opening up new dimensions of innovation for measuring. It is a book worth reading for scholars studying innovation, for policy makers and, not least, for innovation managers in the private sector.\u0027 Bengt-Åke Lundvall, Aalborg University, Denmark and Sciences-Po, Paris, France This Handbook comprehensively examines indicators and statistical measurement related to innovation (as defined in the OECD/Eurostat Oslo Manual). It deals with the development and the use of innovation indicators to support decision-making and is written by authors who are practitioners, who know what works and what does not, in order to improve the development of indicators to satisfy future policy needs. This unique volume presents: the historical and geographical context for innovation indicators and measurement practical examples of how measurement is actually undertaken new areas of innovation indicators and measurement, including consumer innovation, public sector innovation and social innovation. This informative Handbook will appeal to policy makers in government departments, statistical offices and research institutes and international organizations such as the EU, OECD and the UN, as well as university departments of economics, sociology, law, science and technology, and public policy.",

    "description": "Explore various verticals in software engineering through high-end systems using Python Key Features Master the tools and techniques used in software engineering Evaluates available database options and selects one for the final Central Office system-components Experience the iterations software go through and craft enterprise-grade systems Book Description Software Engineering is about more than just writing code--it includes a host of soft skills that apply to almost any development effort, no matter what the language, development methodology, or scope of the project. Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project\u0027s life cycle. This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You\u0027ll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world--Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation. What you will learn Understand what happens over the course of a system\u0027s life (SDLC) Establish what to expect from the pre-development life cycle steps Find out how the development-specific phases of the SDLC affect development Uncover what a real-world development process might be like, in an Agile way Find out how to do more than just write the code Identify the existence of project-independent best practices and how to use them Find out how to design and implement a high-performance computing process Who this book is for Hands-On Software Engineering with Python is for you if you are a developer having basic understanding of programming and its paradigms and want to skill up as a senior programmer. It is assumed that you have basic Python knowledge.",

    "description": "Tracing the historical origin and the critical development of Hellenic philosophy from vague and indeterminate beginnings to its classical maturity and fruition in the minds, words and works of the Athenian philosophers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, this book argues that dignified nobility, respectful critique and unfettered freedom of thought and expression clearly defined the character of Classical Hellenic philosophy and that this distinguishes it from philosophies of different eras. Evangeliou examines the historical influence of Hellenic philosophy and its complex global relations to other non-Hellenic philosophies of Africa, Asia and Europe and also considers certain contemporary and sensitive issues, which relate to the nature of Western culture and European philosophy. Radical and revisionary in nature, this work challenges many of the long cherished myths about the influence of Classical Hellenic philosophy on the tradition of Western thought.",

C. 2247 to the year of Christ 1780, or 1229 of the Armenian era is a translation of an abridged version of the three-volume history of Armenia, originally written in Armenian by Father Mik\u0027ayel Ch\u0027amch\u0027yants\u0027 and published in Venice in 1784-86. Ch\u0027amch\u0027yants\u0027 was born in Istanbul in 1738, and in 1762 he became a member of the Armenian Catholic Mekhitarist order at the St. Lazar Monastery in Venice. Written in chronicle style and based on Armenian and non-Armenian primary source materials, this work by Ch\u0027amch\u0027yants\u0027 was the first critical examination of the history of the Armenian people. In 1811 Ch\u0027amch\u0027yants\u0027 produced an abridged version of the history, which Hovhannēs Avdaleantsʻ (Johannes Avdall) translated into English and which was published in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in 1827. The translation includes a dedication by Avdaleantsʻ to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, a preface by Avdaleantsʻ containing an overview of the history of Armenia and assessments of the most important Armenian historians, and a postscript containing a summary of events in Armenia from 1780 to 1827.",

    "description": "The medieval historian of the Armenian people Movses Khorenatsi was the first Armenian to give a wonderful account of the inception of his nation in Babylon, the power struggles of the Armenian aristocracy, and the final dissolution of the Armenian kingdom. As the author said about his compatriots: \"For although we are a small garden, and are very limited in number, and deprived of power, and have been conquered by other nations many times, still in our country there have been many feats of courage worthy of being immortalized in writing, which, however, none of them cared to record in books.\" The Armenian historian provided a very honest description of the Armenian society not being shy to praise the heroic exploits of some Armenians, such as the courageous founders of the Armenian people - Hayk and Aram, the brave king Tigran, the wise inventor of the Armenian script Mesrop Mashtots, and concurrently being brutal in his criticism of others: \"Therefore, while mourning my people, I will say as Paul said about his enemies and the foes of the cross of Christ, using not my own, but the Holy Spirit’s words. A flawed and disappointing clan, the clan unsettled in heart and unfaithful to God in its spirit! People of Aram! How long will you be hard-hearted, why do you love vanity and godlessness? Do you not realize that the Lord has magnified his saint and that the Lord will not hear when you call to him? For you have become hardened in the Fall and do not repent on your lounges, for you make unlawful sacrifices, and despise those who trust in God.\" The book consists of 3 parts - the genealogy of Great Armenia, the Middle history, and the completion of the history. The final chapter of the book ends with the lament over the loss of the Armenian kingdom:\"I mourn you, the Armenian country, mourn you, the noblest of all the northern (countries), for the king and the priest, the mentor and the teacher were taken away from you; the world got disturbed, the disorder took root, the orthodoxy got shaken, the ignorance affirmed other faith.I am sorry for you, the Armenian church, which has lost the beauty of the altar, deprived of a brave pastor and his companion. I no longer see your intelligent herd grazing on a green meadow and near the waters of rest, or gathered in a sheepfold and protected from the wolves, but (I see) it scattered across the wastelands and the steep mountains.\"",

He finally highlights the emergence of a new quality of cooperation between the Indian and the Armenian people at the end of the 20th century, which came as a result of the establishment of official ties between the newly independent Republic of Armenia and India on August 31, 1992, and presents his own inspirational vision for the future of this cooperation, based on his insights as a key player in its development. The readers will be struck with the drastic contrast between the harmonious integration and prosperity of Armenians in Indian society in the past and the apparent absence of Armenians from the landscape of contemporary Indian culture, business and politics. The exodus of the erstwhile prosperous Armenian population from India was nothing but a misread of the situation and a miscalculation of the country’s future on the part of Indian-Armenians in the 20th century. India- Armenia: So Far Yet So Close is intended to trigger interest in its theme, help readers to visualize the distant past and introduce unfamiliar readers with the vibrant history shared between the two ancient people.",

Stroll effectively makes the case for the use of informal philosophy—that is, an approach guided by common sense, appealing to ordinary discourse, and employing a context-driven line of inquiry—to answer philosophical problems.",

    "description": "The renowned business consultant presents “the battlefield manual for change leadership” —with strategies for thriving in today’s marketplace (Jerry Wind, The Wharton School). Business leadership is a constant struggle to crack through corporate politics, nurture creativity, and add new value to everything they do. In Innovating Innovation, David Morey, one of America’s leading strategic consultants, guides readers across eleven concrete steps that can unlock day-to-day innovation and drive long-term competitive advantage. Innovating Innovation synergizes the best aspects of classic innovation theories with an insurgent strategic model inspired by one of Morey’s first clients, Steve Jobs. It shows how to lead innovation that creates the products of visionary genius without the necessity for actual genius. It provides practical tools and guidance on building and leading the teams, working conditions, organizational structures, and cultures of market-made and market-making innovation. It illustrates a roadmap to the disruptive periphery, the organizational margins at which real innovation takes place. This book invites you to “think different,” to become a change leader, to go the “wrong” way to get to the right places. Reading this book, you will learn:The Disruptive Periphery Concept and the necessary tools it providesHow to apply a marketing-centric focus to innovationLessons developed from thirty years of real-world global consulting and training experience",

    "description": "Actionable tools, processes and metrics for successfully managing innovation projects Conventional project management methods are oftentimes insufficient for managing innovation projects. Innovation is lost under the pre-determined scope and forecasted environments of traditional project management. There is tremendous pressure on organizations to innovate, and the project managers responsible for managing these innovation projects do not have the training or tools to do their jobs effectively. Innovation Project Management provides the tools, insights, and metrics needed to successfully manage innovation projects—helping readers identify problems in their organization, conceive elegant solutions, and, when necessary, promote changes to their organizational culture. There are several kinds of innovation—ranging from incremental changes to existing products to wholly original processes that emerge from market-disrupting new technology—that possess different characteristics and often require different tools. Best-selling author and project management expert Harold Kerzner integrates innovation, project management, and strategic planning to offer students and practicing professionals the essential tools and processes to analyze innovation from all sides. Innovation Project Management deconstructs traditional project management methods and explains why and how innovation projects should be managed differently. This invaluable resource: Provides practical advice and actionable tools for effectively managing innovation projects Offers value-based project management metrics and guidance on how to establish a metrics management program Shares exclusive insights from project managers at world-class organizations such as Airbus, Boeing, Hitachi, IBM, and Siemens on how they manage innovation projects Explores a variety of types of innovation including co-creation, value-driven, agile, open versus closed, and more Instructors have access to PowerPoint lecture slides by chapter through the book’s companion website Innovation Project Management: Methods, Case Studies, and Tools for Managing Innovation Projects is an essential text for professional project managers, corporate managers, innovation team members, as well as students in project management, innovation and entrepreneurship programs.",

    "title": "Innovation Renaissance",
    "subtitle": "Defining, Debunking, and Demystifying Creativity",
    "description": "Innovation is not easy. Understanding the liability of newness but the potential for greatness is the central theme of this work. Innovation Renaissance explores and debunks the myths that have arisen from the proliferation of misleading and often confusing popular press treatments of creativity and innovation. Examples include the notion that successful entrepreneurs are winners because they are innovative—whereas creativity and business start-up acumen are not the same, and are rarely paired—or the idea of disruptive technology, which has now become the buzzword equivalent to radical new technology products or services, despite the fact that new technologies tend to offer simple, limited-capability products or services to satisfy overlooked customer demand. The popularity of open innovation has spawned assumptions, like the idea that crowdsourcing will increase the number of truly new ideas—but in fact the more novel these ideas, the less likely they are to be adopted by incumbent firms because they are less familiar. Starting by defining innovation and the theories that have arisen surrounding it, Ettlie considers individual creativity and innovativeness, radical innovation, new products, new services, process innovation, and information technology. There is special emphasis on neglected topics such as the dark side of the innovation process—the unintended consequences of new ventures. Finally, the last chapter of the book summarizes a prescriptive model of the innovation process and attempts to answer the question: what causes innovation? Three major constructs are explored: leadership, enhancing capabilities and integration. This informative and unique text is designed as a resource for postgraduate students, academics, and professionals deeply committed to understanding and working through the innovation process. The book includes an introduction to the subject before moving on to an in-depth study of emerging evidence and topics in the field.",

Thereby, the innovation status quo of the real estate industry is studied. In addition, the book addresses the impact of slack resources on the organizational members’ innovative work behavior. Overall, important insights about the service industries’ innovation pattern and organizational behavior are revealed. The book acknowledges the increasing role of innovation due to the altering business environment in the 21st century, such as shifts from goods to services, or the globalization of markets. About the Author:Susanne Hügel is an expert in the field of innovation, business model development, and digital transformation in the real estate industry. She wrote her dissertation at the Real Estate Management Institute (REMI) of EBS Business School.",

    "description": "The cost of fixing software design flaws after the completion of a software product is so high that it is vital to come up with ways to detect software design flaws in the early stages of software development, for instance, during the software requirements, the analysis activity, or during software design, before coding starts. It is not uncommon that software requirements are ambiguous or contradict each other. Ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that software requirements are typically written in a natural language, which is not tied to any formal semantics. A palliative to the ambiguity of software requirements is to restrict their syntax to boilerplates, textual templates with placeholders. However, as informal requirements do not enjoy any particular semantics, no essential properties about them (or about the system they attempt to describe) can be proven easily. Formal methods are an alternative to address this problem. They offer a range of mathematical techniques and mathematical tools to validate software requirements in the early stages of software development. This book is a living proof of the use of formal methods to develop software. The particular formalisms that we use are EVENT B and refinement calculus. In short: (i) software requirements as written as User Stories; (ii) they are ported to formal specifications; (iii) they are refined as desired; (iv) they are implemented in the form of a prototype; and finally (v) they are tested for inconsistencies. If some unit-test fails, then informal as well as formal specifications of the software system are revisited and evolved. This book presents a case study of software development of a chat system with EVENT B and a case study of formal proof of properties of a social network.",

    "subtitle": "A Risk-Driven Approach",
    "description": "This is a practical guide for software developers, and different than other software architecture books. Here\u0027s why: It teaches risk-driven architecting. There is no need for meticulous designs when risks are small, nor any excuse for sloppy designs when risks threaten your success. This book describes a way to do just enough architecture. It avoids the one-size-fits-all process tar pit with advice on how to tune your design effort based on the risks you face. It democratizes architecture. This book seeks to make architecture relevant to all software developers. Developers need to understand how to use constraints as guiderails that ensure desired outcomes, and how seemingly small changes can affect a system\u0027s properties. It cultivates declarative knowledge. There is a difference between being able to hit a ball and knowing why you are able to hit it, what psychologists refer to as procedural knowledge versus declarative knowledge. This book will make you more aware of what you have been doing and provide names for the concepts. It emphasizes the engineering. This book focuses on the technical parts of software development and what developers do to ensure the system works not job titles or processes. It shows you how to build models and analyze architectures so that you can make principled design tradeoffs. It describes the techniques software designers use to reason about medium to large sized problems and points out where you can learn specialized techniques in more detail. It provides practical advice. Software design decisions influence the architecture and vice versa. The approach in this book embraces drill-down/pop-up behavior by describing models that have various levels of abstraction, from architecture to data structure design.",

Both a victim and a beneficiary of rival empires, Armenia experienced a complex evolution as a divided or an erased polity with a widespread diaspora. Ronald Grigor Suny traces the cultural and social transformations and interventions that created a new sense of Armenian nationality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Perceptions of antiquity and uniqueness combined in the popular imagination with the experiences of dispersion, genocide, and regeneration to forge an Armenian nation in Transcaucasia. Suny shows that while the limits of Armenia at times excluded the diaspora, now, at a time of state renewal, the boundaries have been expanded to include Armenians who live beyond the borders of the republic.",

Great innovations are always the result of blending the right technology, the right business model, and the right people. But in the end, it always comes back to the people and the organization. Innovation depends on the human beings who make it happen. I have found that to foster and sustain the creative spirit, an organization must understand and act in accordance with the human principles that underlie the innovation process. Understanding these principles requires an honest focus on people and their relationship with business and organizational concerns. Because only human beings create ideas, only human beings can sow the seeds of innovation. In this book, it is my hope to show how focusing on people their unique qualities, their values, and their diverse organizational roles is the most essential step in creating a vibrant, flourishing, innovating organization. Making the Invisible Visible sets forth principles that are necessary to create an innovative culture and help innovation leaders find, fund and nurture the right people. It is for managers, innovation leaders, or anyone inspired by a love of actualized ideas.",

    "description": "Open innovation increases the profit of companies and organizations via the input and the adoption of new ideas that are transformed into new processes, products, and services. Yet, how do we ensure that adopters of such innovations focus on relevant problems and use appropriate methods? How should we manage open innovation technologies? How can we exploit distributed knowledge and inventions? And how can we promote them successfully on the market? With valuable lessons to be learned from academic research and industrial experiences of e.g. Intel, Nokia, Philips Healthcare, small municipalities, e-learning platforms and user communities, this book focuses on some of the key dimensions of open innovation and open innovation technologies. It is divided into three themes: theme 1 deals with open innovation as it is in use today, including theoretical underpinnings and lessons from related research fields. Theme 2 analyzes the use of open innovation in organizations today in order to extract best practices. Theme 3 presents forward-looking theoretical research as well as practical future uses of open innovation. Each chapter addresses the particular topics by presenting experiences and results gained in real life projects and/or by empirical research, and clearly states its purpose and how readers are supposed to benefit from it. Overall, the objectives of this book are to advance and disseminate research on systematic open innovation, and to make its results available to practitioners. Thus, the intended target audience includes the international academic community, industrial enterprises, and public authorities.",

It also explores current dilemmas and future choices independent Armenia faces today. Libaridian concludes with an overview of Armenia and Armenians during the past two decades, including the rebirth of independent Armenia, its foreign and security policy options, its position within the region, and its relations with the Diaspora. Fascinating and timely, Modern Armenia will be of interest to students and scholars of Armenian history, independence movements, the dissolution of the Soviet empire, foreign relations, and political science.",

Or are their thoughts still eminently worth examining with care? Modern Challenges to Past Philosophy argues pondering past philosophy with modern problems in mind is worth the effort, even though earlier works are uninformed by modern science and lack some of tools of modern analysis. The great texts defamiliarize our world and offer solutions to crucial questions often forgotten as we fixate on current philosophical trends. Modern Challenges is no appeal to a return to a golden past but a study designed to show how and why understanding earlier works of some of the most penetrating minds ever to ponder eternally valid questions can contribute to a renewal of our own culture.",

    "description": "Over the past thirty years, there has been much dialogue, and debate, about the conduct of educational technology research and development. In this brief volume, the author helps clarify that dialogue by theoretically and empirically charting the research methods used in the field and provides much practical information on how to conduct educational technology research. Within this text, readers can expect to find answers to the following questions: (a) What are the methodological factors that need to be taken into consideration when designing and conducting educational technology research? (b) What types of research questions do educational technology researchers tend to ask? (c) How do educational technology researchers tend to conduct research? (d) What approaches do they use? What variables do they examine? What types of measures do they use? How do they report their research? (d) How can the state of educational technology research be improved? In addition to answering the questions above, the author, a research methodologist, provides practical information on how to conduct educational technology research--from formulating research questions, to collecting and analyzing data, to writing up the research reports--in each of the major quantitative and qualitative traditions. Unlike other books of this kind, the author addresses some of research approaches used less commonly in educational technology research, but which, nonetheless, have much potential for creating new insights about educational phenomena--approaches such as single-participant research, quantitative content analysis, ethnography, narrative research, phenomenology, and others. \"Multidisciplinary Methods in Educational Technology Research and Development\" is an excellent text for educational technology research methods courses, a useful guide for those conducting (or supervising) research, and a rich source of empirical information on the art and science of educational technology research. Key Questions in Educational Technology Methods Choice are appended. (Contains 13 figures and 13 tables.) [This publication was produced by the HAMK University of Applied Sciences.].",

    "subtitle": null,
    "description": "This book packs up the question of a science named \"techno-logy\", a science of technique allowing us to conceive its foundations,forms and issues. Its title harks back to Jacob Bigelow\u0027s Elements of Technology (1829), a collection of lectures given at Harvard. Bigelow supports an articulation between science and technique in which science focuses on technical applications and in which techniques (\"useful arts\") feed on scientific advances. We have inherited such a definition of technique which is seen as a neutral, mechanical and transparent application of science and thus masked by it. It is precisely this paradigm which we intend to question in this book by sketching the outlines of a technology thought as a science of technique. We think we can develop a scientific knowledge of technique without limiting the latter to a mere application of science. We are sure that the instauration of a \"techno-logy\" can contribute to redesigning the type of education given in engineering universities, placing at its core a true science of technique encompassing design, creativity, innovation and aiso the critical exercise of a conception of technique. Several French researchers from different disciplines have been invited to contribute to this book which is for us the beginning of a dialogue with our English-speaking academic counterparts and a manner of contributing to the distribution of works illustrating a French tradition of reflection on technology.",

Alexis came to Mixergy to tell the story of how he launched and sold Reddit. If you\u0027re a founder, you know the kind of problems that founders have, right? Figuring out what product to create, how to build it, how to get users to try it, etc. Well Alexis didn\u0027t seem to have those problems, or at least they weren\u0027t as challenging for him as they were for most of the other 600 entrepreneurs I interviewed on Mixergy. Why? Because Paul Graham helped him launch his business. How did Graham make Reddit\u0027s launch easier and more successful than other companies\u0027 founding? How did he do the same for hundreds of other startups? And, more importantly, what can you learn from his experiences to grow your business? The book you\u0027re holding has those answers. Use what you\u0027re about to learn to build your successful startup. After you do, I hope you\u0027ll let me interview you so other founders can learn from your experience, the way you\u0027re about to benefit from Graham\u0027s.",

    "description": "Only recently has the phenomenon of technology become an object of in terest for philosophers. The first attempts at a philosophy of technology date back scarcely a hundred years - a span of time extremely short when com pared with the antiquity of philosophical reflections on nature, science, and society. Over that hundred-year span, speculative, critical, and empiricist approaches of various sorts have been put forward. Nevertheless, even now there remains a broad gap between the importance of technology in the real world and the sparse number of philosophical works dedicated to the under standing of modern technology. As a result of the complex structure of modern technology, it can be dealt with in very different ways. These range from metaphysical exposition to efforts aimed at political consensus. Quite naturally, within such a broad range, certain national accents can be discovered-; they are shaped by a com mon language, accepted philosophical traditions, and concrete problems requiring consideration. Even so, the worldwide impact of technology, its penetration into all spheres of individual, social, and cultural life, together with the urgency of the problems raised in this context - all these demand a joint philosophical discussion that transcends the barriers of language and cultural differences. The papers printed here are intended to exemplify such an effort at culture-transcending philosophical discussion.",

The book is structured in three parts around the key issues and themes in philosophy of law: what is the law? : the major legal theories addressing the question of what we mean by law, including natural law, legal positivism and legal realism; the reach of the law : the various legal theories on the nature and extent of the law\u0027s authority, with regard to obligation and civil disobedience, rights, liberty and privacy; and criminal law : responsibility and mens rea, intention, recklessness and murder, legal defences, insanity and philosophies of punishment ... Revisions include a more detailed analysis of natural law, new chapters on common law and the development of positivism, a reassessment of the Austin-Hart dispute in the light of recent criticism of Hart, a new chapter on the natural law-positivist controversy over Nazi law and legality, and new chapters on criminal law, extending the analysis of the dispute over the viability of the defences of necessity and duress.\"--",

    "title": "Philosophy of Perception",
    "subtitle": "A Contemporary Introduction",
    "description": "The philosophy of perception investigates the nature of our sensory experiences and their relation to reality. In the second edition of this popular book, William Fish introduces the subject thematically, setting out the major theories of perception together with their motivations and attendant problems. While providing historical background to debates in the field, this comprehensive overview focuses on recent presentations and defenses of the different theories, and looks beyond visual perception to take into account the role of other senses. The second edition organizes the contents into two main parts: the first deals with philosophical theories of perception, and the second covers key topics and issues in perception as they are discussed in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. Two completely new chapters have been added – one on color and color vision; and a second on the interaction between sense modalities – and other chapters have been significantly updated to include discussion of topics such as pre-twentieth-century philosophy of perception, phenomenal intentionality, color adverbialism, predictive processing approaches to perception, ecological approaches to perception, and in-depth discussions of the non-visual senses. Additional updates include fuller and easier-to-understand explanations of some important views that were glossed over in the first edition and greater coverage of research from the last 25 years. All chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter have been brought up to date and the volume now includes a more extensive index at the back of the book. Key Features and Benefits: The only single-authored textbook on philosophy of perception currently available Devoted to contemporary theories and topics, but with appropriate historical coverage for fuller understanding of contemporary work Each chapter includes a chapter overview, questions for further consideration, and an annotated list of Suggested Reading Includes coverage of topics like: the phenomenal principle perception and hallucination perception and content naïve realism and disjunctivism intentionalism and representationalism the nature of content qualia theories and phenomenal intentionality perception and empirical science color and color science theories of non-visual perception Molyneux’s problem cross-modal illusions multimodality Key Changes to the Second Edition The division of the book into two major parts: Part I on philosophical theories of perception, Part II on key interdisciplinary topics in perception The addition of two new chapters on color and color vision, and interaction between different sense modalities More topics from the last 25 years of philosophy of perception Combined chapters on belief acquisition theories and intentional theories into one larger chapter More material on the growing intersection of the philosophy and psychology of perception Includes coverage of Molyneux’s problem and of cross-modal illusions Updated chapter summaries, references, and Suggested Reading lists at the end of each chapter A summary table and a more extensive index",

It provides concepts, methods, and tools that can help accelerate the introduction of successful products to the market in an increasingly competitive and changing business landscape. It also offers examples and case studies, and it is the result of more than 20 years of study, research, and consulting carried out by the two authors in the field of innovation management. The book discusses the demanding challenges of product innovation and offers practitioners guidance on how to respond to these challenges. It presents a three-level framework (the “innovation pyramid”), which reflects the core components of a firm’s innovation capability: first, intelligence - absorbing information and knowledge from the outside world by looking beyond the familiar territories of the current market, technology, and customers; second, discovery - exploring opportunities for innovation through creative ideation and technology experimentation; and third, development - transforming opportunities into profitable new products and services.",

    "description": "\"Professional Financial Computing Using Excel and VBA is an admirable exposition that bridges the theoretical underpinnings of financial engineering and its application which usually appears as a \"black-box\" software application. The book opens the black-box and reveals the architecture of risk-modeling and financial engineering based on industry-standard stochastic models by utilizing Excel and VBA functionality to create a robust and practical modeling tool-kit. Financial engineering professionals who purchase this book will have a jumpstart advantage for their customized financial engineering and modeling needs.\" Dr. Cameron Wicentowich Vice President, Treasury Analytics Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) \"Spreadsheet modeling for finance has become a standard course in the curriculum of many Quantitative Finance programs since the Excel-based Visual Basic programming is now widely used in constructing optimal portfolios, pricing structured products and managing risks. Professional Financial Computing Using Excel and VBA is written by a unique team of finance, physics and computer academics and practitioners. It is a good reference for those who are studying for a Masters degree in Financial Engineering and Risk Management. It can also be useful for financial engineers to jump-start a project on designing structured products, modeling interest term structure or credit risks.\" Dr. Jin Zhang Director of Master of Finance Program and Associate Professor The University of Hong Kong \"Excel has been one of the most powerful tools for financial planning and computing over the last few years. Most users utilize a fraction of its capabilities. One of the reasons is the limited availability of books that cover the advanced features of Excel for Finance. Professional Financial Computing Using Excel and VBA goes the extra mile and deals with the Excel tools many professionals call for. This book is a must for professionals or students dealing with financial engineering, financial risk management, computational finance or mathematical finance. I loved the way the authors covered the material using real life, hands-on examples.\" Dr. Isaac Gottlieb Temple University Author, Next Generation Excel: Modeling in Excel for Analysts and MBAs",

    "description": "New media technologies have become a central part of the sports media landscape. Sports fans use new media to watch games, discuss sports transactions, form fan-based communities, and secure minutiae about their favorite players and teams. Never before have fans known so much about athletes, whether that happens via Twitter feeds, fan sites, or blogs, and never before have the lines between producer, consumer, enactor, fan and athlete been more blurred. The Internet has made virtually everything available for sports media consumption; it has also made understanding sports media substantially more complex. The Routledge Handbook of Sport and New Media is the most comprehensive and in-depth study of the impact of new media in sport ever to be published. Adopting a broad, interdisciplinary approach, the book explores new media in sport as a cultural, social, commercial, economic, and technological phenomenon, examining the profound impact of digital technologies on that the way that sport is produced, consumed and understood. There is no aspect of social life or commercial activity in general that is not being radically influenced by the rise of new media forms, and by offering a \"state of the field\" survey of work in this area, the Routledge Handbook of Sport and New Media is important reading for any advanced student, researcher or practitioner with an interest in sports studies, media studies or communication studies.",

It\u0027s the birthplace of the world\u0027s most successful high-tech companies-including Apple, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and many more. So what\u0027s the secret? What is it about Silicon Valley that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation? With Silicon Valley, Planet Startup, Peter Ester and Arne Maas argue that the answer lies in Silicon Valley\u0027s culture-a corporate culture that values risk-taking, creativity, invention, and sharing. Through extensive interviews with Dutch entrepreneurs working in the area, Ester and Maas show that Silicon Valley is above all a mind-set: a belief in thinking, with passion and ambition, far beyond the here and now. Scholars and business people and budding entrepreneurs alike are sure to find both inspiration and illumination in the stories and analyses Ester and Maas have assembled here.",

    "description": "This book examines how social issues shape and influence our engagement with sport, leisure time physical activity, and health-promoting exercise. Connecting the personal with the public, it helps the reader understand how individual exercise, leisure, and sport participation are both facilitated and constrained by their social contexts. Presenting a series of in-depth descriptions of grassroots sport, urban lifestyle sport, physical activity across the life course, sport for children with special needs, and the development of creative climates in sport, this book seeks to encourage what C. Wright Mills described as the “sociological imagination”. Every chapter begins with an individual-level account centred on everyday challenges with accessing sport, partaking in leisure activities, and meeting guidelines for daily exercise before exploring the larger, socially determined patterns in which those experiences are located, establishing a vital template for the social scientific study of sport, leisure, and health. Touching on key contemporary themes including diversity, inclusion, health inequalities, and physical inactivity, as well as selection and intensification in sports, this book offers new case material and theoretical tools for understanding the relationships between sport, leisure, health, and the wider society. This is an indispensable companion for any course on the sociology of sport, exercise, leisure, or physical activity and health.",

    "description": "Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include \"old\" software and \"historical\" programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques. Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.",

Scientific software is needed to solve CAPE related problems by industry/academia for research and development, for education and training and much more. There are increasing demands for CAPE software to be versatile, flexible, efficient, and reliable. This means that the role of software architecture is also gaining increasing importance. Software architecture needs to reconcile the objectives of the software; the framework defined by the CAPE methods; the computational algorithms; and the user needs and tools (other software) that help to develop the CAPE software. The object of this book is to bring to the reader, the software side of the story with respect to computer aided process engineering.",

    "description": "Software effort estimation is a key element of software project planning and management. Yet, in industrial practice, the important role of effort estimation is often underestimated and/or misunderstood. In this book, Adam Trendowicz presents the CoBRA method (an abbreviation for Cost Estimation, Benchmarking, and Risk Assessment) for estimating the effort required to successfully complete a software development project, which uniquely combines human judgment and measurement data in order to systematically create a custom-specific effort estimation model. CoBRA goes far beyond simply predicting the development effort; it supports project decision-makers in negotiating the project scope, managing project risks, benchmarking productivity, and directing improvement activities. To illustrate the method’s practical use, the book reports several real-world cases where CoBRA was applied in various industrial contexts. These cases represent different estimation contexts in terms of software project environment, estimation objectives, and estimation constraints. This book is the result of a successful collaboration between the process management division of Fraunhofer IESE and many software companies in the field of software engineering technology transfer. It mainly addresses software practitioners who deal with planning and managing software development projects as part of their daily work, and is also of interest for students or courses specializing in software engineering or software project management.",

Even now, software engineering is more of a wish than a reality, but the last few years have seen an increased awareness of the need to apply an engineering-type discipline to the design and construction of software systems. Many new proposals have been made for the management of software development and maintenance and many methodologies have been suggested for improving the programming process. As these problems and solutions become better understood, there is a growing need to teach these concepts to students and to practicing professionals. As a prelude to the educational process, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the software design and development process in industry and government, to define the appropriate job categories, and to identify the fundamental content areas of soft ware engineering. The need for quality education in software engineering is now recognized by practitioners and educators alike, and various educational endeavors in this area are now being formulated. Yet, discussions we had had over the past year or so led us to believe that there was insufficient contact between practitioners and educators, with the resultant danger that each group would go off in separate ways rather than working together.",

Software engineering (SE) is the design, development, testing, and implementation of software applications, and this discipline is as well developed as the practice is well established whereas the Cloud Software Engineering (CSE) is the design, development, testing, and continuous delivery of service-oriented software systems and applications (Software as a Service Paradigm). However, with the emergence of the highly attractive cloud computing (CC) paradigm, the tools and techniques for SE are changing. CC provides the latest software development environments and the necessary platforms relatively easily and inexpensively. It also allows the provision of software applications equally easily and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Business requirements for the use of software are also changing and there is a need for applications in big data analytics, parallel computing, AI, natural language processing, and biometrics, etc. These require huge amounts of computing power and sophisticated data management mechanisms, as well as device connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. In terms of hardware, software, communication, and storage, CC is highly attractive for developing complex software that is rapidly becoming essential for all sectors of life, including commerce, health, education, and transportation. The book fills a gap in the SE literature by providing scientific contributions from researchers and practitioners, focusing on frameworks, methodologies, applications, benefits and inherent challenges/barriers to engineering software using the CC paradigm.",

Studies of software evolution are central to the understanding and practice of software development. Yet it has received relatively little attention in the field of software engineering. This book focuses on topics aimed at giving a scientific insight into the aspect of software evolution and feedback. In summary, the book covers conceptual, phenomenological, empirical, technological and theoretical aspects of the field of software evolution - with contributions from the leading experts. This book delivers an up-to-date scientific understanding of what software evolution is, to show why it is inevitable for real world applications, and it demonstrates the role of feedback in software development and maintenance. The book also addresses some of the phenomenological and technological underpinnings and includes rules and guidelines for increased software evolvability and, in general, sustainability of the evolution process. Software Evolution and Feedback provides a long overdue, scientific focus on software evolution and the role of feedback in the software process, making this the indispensable guide for all software practitioners, researchers and managers in the software industry.",

Within REQUEST. the research described in this volume. concerning those special problems of software that is required to have extremely high reliability. was particularly difficult and ambitious. The problems of software reliability are essentially twofold. On the one hand there is a concern with methods for achieving adequate reliability. on the other hand there is a need to evaluate what has actually been achieved in a particular case. Naturally. far more effort has been spent over the years on the former problem; indeed. there is a sense in which all of conventional software engineering can be seen as a response to this problem. However. it is becoming clearer than ever that we can only claim to have a truly sCientific approach. and so justify the description software engineering. when we are able to measure the attributes of process and product. It is still common to find software development methods recommended to users on purely anecdotal grounds. This is not good enough. Rational choices between rival approaches can only be made on the basis of quantified costs and benefits. Even more worrying is the tendency to argue that a software product can be depended upon merely because it has been developed by honest men using such anecdotal \u0027good practice\u0027.",

    "subtitle": "Modeling Enterprise Architectures",
    "description": "This book introduces a new approach for modeling large enterprise systems: the software fortress model. In the software fortress model, an enterprise architecture is viewed as a series of self-contained, mutually suspicious, marginally cooperating software fortresses interacting with each other through carefully crafted and meticulously managed treaty relationships. The software fortress model is an intuitive, simple, expressive approach that maps readily to existing technologies such as .NET and Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE). This book is designed to meet an immediate need to define, clarify, and explain the basics of this new modeling methodology for large enterprise software architectures. \"Software Fortresses is your essential roadmap to all aspects of software fortresses. Key topics include: The fundamental concepts and terminology of software fortressesDocumentation techniques, including Fortress Ally Responsibility Cards (based on Class Responsibility Cards) and Sequence Ally Diagrams (based on UML\u0027s Class Sequence Diagrams)The proper use of drawbridges to provide fortress interoperabilityThe innovative software fortress model for enterprise securityCorrect design approaches to fortress walls, which keep intruders out, and to guards, which let allies in.The role of loosely coupled and tightly coupled transactions in a software fortress architectureDesign and technology issues associated with the six major software fortress types This book is a must-read for all enterprise software professionals, whether you are a manager seeking to rein in run-away enterprise system complexity, an architect seeking to design interoperable, scalable, and highly secure systems, aconsultant expected to give advice on how .NET and J2EE fit into the enterprise space, an implementer wanting to understand how your system relates to a larger enterprise architecture, or a business analyst needing to know that your system requirements will be translated into a successful software implementation. 0321166086B12202002",

    "title": "Software Performability: From Concepts to Applications",
    "subtitle": null,
    "description": "Computers are currently used in a variety of critical applications, including systems for nuclear reactor control, flight control (both aircraft and spacecraft), and air traffic control. Moreover, experience has shown that the dependability of such systems is particularly sensitive to that of its software components, both the system software of the embedded computers and the application software they support. Software Performability: From Concepts to Applications addresses the construction and solution of analytic performability models for critical-application software. The book includes a review of general performability concepts along with notions which are peculiar to software performability. Since fault tolerance is widely recognized as a viable means for improving the dependability of computer system (beyond what can be achieved by fault prevention), the examples considered are fault-tolerant software systems that incorporate particular methods of design diversity and fault recovery. Software Performability: From Concepts to Applications will be of direct benefit to both practitioners and researchers in the area of performance and dependability evaluation, fault-tolerant computing, and dependable systems for critical applications. For practitioners, it supplies a basis for defining combined performance-dependability criteria (in the form of objective functions) that can be used to enhance the performability (performance/dependability) of existing software designs. For those with research interests in model-based evaluation, the book provides an analytic framework and a variety of performability modeling examples in an application context of recognized importance. The material contained in this book will both stimulate future research on related topics and, for teaching purposes, serve as a reference text in courses on computer system evaluation, fault-tolerant computing, and dependable high-performance computer systems.",

    "title": "Software and Mind",
    "subtitle": "The Mechanistic Myth and Its Consequences",
    "description": "Addressing general readers as well as software practitioners, \"Software and Mind\" discusses the fallacies of the mechanistic ideology and the degradation of minds caused by these fallacies. Mechanism holds that every aspect of the world can be represented as a simple hierarchical structure of entities. But, while useful in fields like mathematics and manufacturing, this idea is generally worthless, because most aspects of the world are too complex to be reduced to simple hierarchical structures. Our software-related affairs, in particular, cannot be represented in this fashion. And yet, all programming theories and development systems, and all software applications, attempt to reduce real-world problems to neat hierarchical structures of data, operations, and features. Using Karl Popper\u0027s famous principles of demarcation between science and pseudoscience, the book shows that the mechanistic ideology has turned most of our software-related activities into pseudoscientific pursuits. Using mechanism as warrant, the software elites are promoting invalid, even fraudulent, software notions. They force us to depend on generic, inferior systems, instead of allowing us to develop software skills and to create our own systems. Software mechanism emulates the methods of manufacturing, and thereby restricts us to high levels of abstraction and simple, isolated structures. The benefits of software, however, can be attained only if we start with low-level elements and learn to create complex, interacting structures. Software, the book argues, is a non-mechanistic phenomenon. So it is akin to language, not to physical objects. Like language, it permits us to mirror the world in our minds and to communicate with it. Moreover, we increasingly depend on software in everything we do, in the same way that we depend on language. Thus, being restricted to mechanistic software is like thinking and communicating while being restricted to some ready-made sentences supplied by an elite. Ultimately, by impoverishing software, our elites are achieving what the totalitarian elite described by George Orwell in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" achieves by impoverishing language: they are degrading our minds.",

In thisVery Short Introduction, Mike Cronin charts the history of sport, from its traditional origins in folk football and cock fighting to its position as a global phenomenon today. Looking at a variety of sports from team games such as rugby, cricket, and football to games for individuals such as golf, tennis, and skiing, he considers how these first emerged and captivated the interest of ordinary people, and how sport has been transformed within our daily lives. Exploring the relationship between sport and class, gender, commerce, identity, and ethics, Cronin considers some of the central issues in sport today, including the high pay of professional footballers and the glamour of women in sports, as well as fair play standards. Charting sport through the ages and around the world, this is a short guide to the history, development, and place of sport in contemporary global society.

It provides a theoretical approach to sport and development. It begins by addressing the basic concepts of sport development and sustainability and then discusses the potential contribution of sport to five prioritized SDGs (SDGs 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16) and the environment as one of the sustainable development pillars that may contribute to SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. This academic resource provides a macro view to students and researchers of sports sciences to know more about the fundamental concepts of sustainable development goals, and to enhance their knowledge about sport as a conduit that can help achieve wider development outcomes rather than being an end in itself. This book is of interest to students and researchers of sports studies, from sociology to management, and researchers and policy makers interested in sport and sustainable development.",

    "description": "Why are the Olympic Games the driving force behind a clampdown on civil liberties? What makes sport an unwavering ally of nationalism and militarism? Is sport the new opiate of the masses? These and many other questions are answered in this new radical history of sport by leading historian of sport and society, Professor Tony Collins. Tracing the history of modern sport from its origins in the burgeoning capitalist economy of mid-eighteenth century England to the globalised corporate sport of today, the book argues that, far from the purity of sport being ‘corrupted’ by capitalism, modern sport is as much a product of capitalism as the factory, the stock exchange and the unemployment line. Based on original sources, the book explains how sport has been shaped and moulded by the major political and economic events of the past two centuries, such as the French Revolution, the rise of modern nationalism and imperialism, the Russian Revolution, the Cold War and the imposition of the neo-liberal agenda in the last decades of the twentieth century. It highlights the symbiotic relationship between the media and sport, from the simultaneous emergence of print capitalism and modern sport in Georgian England to the rise of Murdoch’s global satellite television empire in the twenty-first century, and for the first time it explores the alternative, revolutionary models of sport in the early twentieth century. Sport in a Capitalist Society is the first sustained attempt to explain the emergence of modern sport around the world as an integral part of the globalisation of capitalism. It is essential reading for anybody with an interest in the history or sociology of sport, or the social and cultural history of the modern world.",

    "description": "The forthcoming Olympics in Rio in 2016, and the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 2014, highlight the profound importance of sport in Latin America. This book is the first to offer a broad survey of the way that sport is managed, governed and organized across the Latin American region, drawing on cutting-edge contemporary scholarship in management, policy, sociology and history. The book explores key themes in Latin American sport, including the role of public institutions; the relationship between sport policy and political regimes; the structure and significance of national governing bodies and professional leagues; the impact of sporting mega-events (including the Olympics and World Cup), and the management and governance of football, the dominant sport in the region. Including contributions from Latin American scholars and practitioners, the book draws on important Spanish and Portuguese sources that are unknown to most English-speaking researchers, and therefore provides an unprecedented and authoritative insight into sport policy and management in the region. Including cases from sport in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Peru and examples from Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, this book is essential reading for all scholars, practitioners and policy-makers with an interest in Latin American sport, comparative sport policy, sport management, or Latin American history, culture and society.",

They liken the circumstances to previous governments that used the games to glorify their regimes - most notoriously the Nazis in 1936. What has led to this perception and is it fair? Sport, Revolution and the Beijing Olympics is a cultural history of sport in China and challenges many such ingrained Western assumptions. The authors unpick the relationship of sport to imperialism and revolution, and examine its significance in both China and Taiwan at governmental and everyday levels. In the process, they successfully debunk harmful myths, such as the prevalence of drugs in Chinese sport among women athletes, and present a balanced view that is a much-needed corrective to popular understanding.",

    "description": "Budding entrepreneurs face a challenging road. The path is not made any easier by all the clichés they hear about how to make a startup succeed--from platitudes and conventional wisdom to downright contradictions. This witty and wise guide to the dilemmas of entrepreneurship debunks widespread misconceptions about how the world of startups works and offers hard-earned advice for every step of the journey. Instead of startup myths--legends spun from a fantasy version of Silicon Valley--Rizwan Virk provides startup models--frameworks that help make thoughtful decisions about starting, growing, managing, and selling a business. Rather than dispensing simplistic rules, he mentors readers in the development of a mental toolkit for approaching challenges based on how startup markets evolve in real life. In snappy prose with savvy pop-culture and real-world examples, Virk recasts entrepreneurship as a grand adventure. He points out the pitfalls that appear along the way and offers insights into how to avoid them, sharing the secrets of founding a startup, raising money, hiring and firing, when to enter a market and when to exit, and how to value a company. Virk combines lessons learned the hard way during his twenty-five years of founding, investing in, and advising startups with reflections from well-known venture capitalists and experts. His candid advice makes Startup Myths and Models an ideal guide for those readers just embarking on the startup life and those looking for their next adventure.",

    "description": "#1 Amazon Best Seller in Entrepreneurship, Startups, Innovation, and Christian Business categories This book is for anyone who has ever dreamed of starting something. Thinking about starting your own company? Curious about what startup life is really like? Looking to commiserate over the brutality that is the road called entrepreneurship? This book is for you. In Startup Stories, serial entrepreneur Jordan Raynor gives an honest look at what it takes to launch a company, grind through startup life, and grow a business from the ground up. Using stories from his most recent endeavor (Citizinvestor – the largest crowdfunding platform for government projects in the U.S., currently valued at $3,500,000), Jordan shares a series of lessons that are critical for any entrepreneur to learn. In this short book, you\u0027ll hear Jordan share stories about: How he met his \"startup spouse\" and learned what makes a great business partnership Why his team wrote stories about their product before registering a domain name or hiring a developer Raising capital from Silicon Valley and friends and family The wild emotional roller coaster ride startups put you through How he gets meetings with amazing people simply by having the audacity to ask How to be content regardless of the success or failure of your startup This won\u0027t feel like another “how to” book. Raynor\u0027s casual style will make you feel as if the two of you are swapping stories over your favorite cup of coffee. If you\u0027ve ever been interested in starting something, you\u0027ll want to start reading Startup Stories today. An excerpt from Startup Stories: In a few minutes, I was to take the stage following an amazing “fireside chat” with Chris Hughes, a Co-founder of Facebook and the leader of the Obama campaign\u0027s historic “My Barack Obama” social network. If that wasn\u0027t cool enough, the rest of the lineup of speakers at the event included the CEOs of The New York Times, The Guardian, and Tumblr; the CTO of Amazon.com; a General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz, and a former United States Senator. And then there was me, Jordan Raynor, a Co- founder of a company no one could properly pronounce. To say I was out of my league would be an epic understatement. As a friend of mine said to me a few days before the speech, “Dude, I think you\u0027re great and all, but you have no business being on that stage.” My friend was right. So how did this happen? Mostly through grace. In my short career as an entrepreneur, I have been blessed immeasurably with amazing opportunities I did not earn or deserve. But as I inched closer to the edge of my seat, ready to charge the podium, I couldn\u0027t help but think that one of the reasons I was there was because the team at our young startup had decided to solve a real problem. By focusing on a problem of such great importance, we have gained access to more amazing people and opportunities in two years than most people get in a lifetime. We have been invited to The White House to talk about what implications crowdfunding might have on the federal government; we were featured alongside a movie with Matt Damon; we were flown to France to address the Council of Europe; we had tea with the Lieutenant Governor of California. Even if Citizinvestor were to fail, the experiences we have had along the way would have made it all worthwhile. I believe these experiences are a direct result of us tackling a significant problem.",

    "subtitle": "Towards a Sustainable and Profitable National Innovation System",
    "description": "This book presents a radically different approach to innovation aimed at creating new growth cycles for the Russian economy. To better grasp the opportunities hidden behind worldwide megatrends, such as the growing economic prosperity of Asian countries and the importance of the internet-based economy, the authors argue for a reinvention of Russia’s innovation strategy. Instead of a purely technology-driven approach, the authors illustrate how the principles of strategic innovation help develop institutional and non-technical innovation, as well as new forms of leadership and entrepreneurship within the Russian business culture. The authors also discuss the impact of strategic innovation on corporate strategies, innovation and economic policy, as well as academic research and development agendas. The book also sheds new light on how cooperation between Russia and the EU, the US and China in the area of innovation can be of mutual benefit.",

    "description": "The innovation economy sets new standards for global business and requires efficient innovation management to plan, execute and evaluate innovation activities, establish innovative capability and coordinate resources and capacities for innovation on an intra- and inter-organizational level. Moreover, communication of innovation is one essential impact factor of innovation success due to successful launches of innovations into markets, establishment of stakeholder relationships, and strengthened corporate reputation in the long-run. Consequently, the portfolio of communication activities for innovations has to be mastered by a company or collaborative network equal to the innovation portfolio. Thus, management of innovation and innovation communication on a strategic level play an important role in business nowadays. This new book concentrates on new approaches and methods for strategies and communications for innovations. As one part of the book, integrated perspectives on strategy and communication for innovation intend to bridge the gap between innovation management and communication management. This new book shall contribute to management science and answer current question in business. It provides cutting-edge information and offers a knowledge source for researchers, students, and business representatives who design, implement and manage innovation and innovation communication / marketing of innovation.",

It is an appropriate framework for the empirical study of innovations in their contexts and is relevant for policy makers. This text is the result of the work within an international inter-disciplinary network or \"working seminar\" with the task of building a more solid and sophisticated conceptual and theoretical foundation for the continued study of innovations in a systemic context. The book has three parts. The first presents an overview and tries to work out some conceptual problems. In the second, the systems of innovation approach is related to innovation theory. Part three is devoted to increasing understanding of the functioning and dynamics of systems of innovation. There is also an introduction where the genesis and anatomy of different systems of innovation approaches are discussed and where the systems of innovation approach is characterized in nine dimensions.",

    "subtitle": "Origins, Managerial Responses, and Firm Performance",
    "description": "Radical technological changes (so-called \"technology shocks\") frequently disrupt the competitive market structure. New entrants appear, industries need to be redefined, incumbents lose their positions or vanish completely. Fast moving industries - like the often quoted example of the semiconductor industry - have preferably been analyzed for these phenomena. But do the findings hold for industries with longer development cycles like the global machine tool industry? Here, multivariate analysis is used to find out what management needs to focus on in order to lead companies through the technology shocks. The research for this book builds on in-depth interviews with 100 experts and decision makers from the machine tool industry involved in technology shocks and statistical analysis of detailed quantitative surveys collected from 58 companies. In several instances the results challenge classical teaching of technology management. Adrian J. Slywotzky - US top selling business author and one of the most distinguished intellectual leaders in business - comments: \"In Technology Shocks, Heinrich Arnold develops a very useful model for analyzing technology shocks, and for focusing on those factors that will enable a company to navigate through these shocks successfully, and repeatedly. Although this work is focused on technology, its thinking has useful implications beyond technology shocks. It provides ideas that managers can use to protect their firms when they are faced with any type of discontinuity, technology-based or not\".",

    "description": "The printed book is one of life’s most frequently encountered technologies. Historian Nicole Howard provides a comprehensive survey of the evolution of this technology, tracing its development across many centuries and cultures. No other technology in human history, declares Howard, has had the impact of this invention. By examining the book as a technology, Howard reveals how profoundly information and media have shaped history and how vital the technology of the book has been to cultural and intellectual change. This engaging study extends from clay tablets and rolls of papyrus to bound folio sheets, from inks and scripts to lead type and printing presses, from the Linotype machine to the laptop. Cross-cultural in scope, it examines innovations in the production and manufacture of books from the Middle and Far East, Europe, and the Americas. Howard recounts printing techniques from Gutenberg’s first press to 21st-century electronic publishing. Howard’s broad overview and accessible writing style make this book ideal for students and bibliophiles alike. The volume includes a glossary of terms, a timeline of important events, and a selected bibliography of useful resources for further information.",

A more proactive role for business in sustainable development is especially pertinent in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been plagued by conflict and poverty but shows signs of a brighter future as the world’s second-fastest-growing region. The book considers how the socio-economic context influences the objectives of social innovation and even our definition of what we mean by social innovation.

    "description": "Excerpt from The Growth of Modern Philosophy Philosophy may be at once, in the best sense of both words, popular and scientific. Plain speech does not make exact thinking impossible; and indeed there is authority enough, even in the work of recognised philosophers, for treating of the highest problems in the simplest language. Plato did not write textbooks, but dialogues which might be read outside the school; and Hume confessed to an attempt at being \"ambassador from the realms of learning to those of conversation\" - not, perhaps, without a smile at these divided kingdoms. The distrust of philosophic terminology, so common in England, is a most valuable corrective for those uncouth obscurities with which philosophers sometimes mistakenly attempt to glorify their subject.

Ernst Cassirer here examines the changes brewing in the early stages of the Renaissance, tracing the interdependence of philosophy, language, art, and science; the newfound recognition of individual consciousness; and the great thinkers of the period—from da Vinci and Galileo to Pico della Mirandola and Giordano Bruno. The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy discusses the importance of fifteenth-century philosopher Nicholas Cusanus, the concepts of freedom and necessity, and the subject-object problem in Renaissance thought. “This fluent translation of a scholarly and penetrating original leaves little impression of an attempt to show that a ‘spirit of the age’ or ‘spiritual essence of the time’ unifies and expresses itself in all aspects of society or culture.”—Philosophy",

The Twenty-first century requires twenty first century solutions. In this groundbreaking book, Praveen Gupta provides an easy to understand, powerful innovation framework for anyone interested in learning about innovation and striving for success at the personal or organizational level. But more than that, it demonstrates that innovation skills can be taught and learned for pursuing ones passion and growth. Gupta has recognized that Innovation is a learned skill, and he has applied Einstein\u0027s revolutionary work correlating innovation as a function of ones speed of thought to develop his overall framework. Known as Breakthrough Innovation (or Brinnovation), this framework has combined strategies for success, the Rule of Two, management techniques, measures, return on innovation, a curriculum to jump-start an innovation initiative and the powerful TEDOC methodology (Target, Explore, Develop, Optimize, and Commercialize). Systematically explaining the various aspects of innovation and how they impact companies in the knowledge age, Gupta shares his own experience in what is arguably the most profoundly affecting innovation management book available for the casual reader and seasoned veteran alike. Surprising, challenging, and altogether inspiring, The Innovation Solution is a life-altering guide to jump-starting a dynamic profitable future.",

    "description": "Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs—in companies of all sizes—a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",

    "description": "Innovation is one of the avenues in which companies can move up the value chain, and has become a popular demand from stock markets and governments. Many of its proponents though lack insight as to what it takes to be an innovator, and instead hype and impel innovation based on a romanticized view that with enough willpower and support from a board, investors, or government every company can pursue innovation. This book offers a theoretical framework, the License Giver Business concept, that clarifies the core characteristics of a truly innovating company, and differentiates it from three other company archetypes with differing core business identities. It describes key aspects and pitfalls in the practical application of the License Giver Business concept and provides cases from the marine industry and computer industry.",

In particular, it provides a good introduction to broader aspects of the field of innovation for researchers based within the engineering and science traditions\u0027 - Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management `Howells has synthesised a broad range of sources with considerable insight to provide the first sophisticated single volume on innovation that draws on economics, sociology, law and from the history of science and technology. By setting innovation in social and institutional context, he convincingly shows how firms and markets shape and can be shaped by the decisions of managers and entrepreneurs. I will certainly be using this book as a central text for my Masters degree teaching on innovation management, management of technology and related topics\u0027 - Jonathan Liebenau, London School of Economics and Columbia University `A great strength of the book is the extensive and detailed integration of rich case study analyses into the main flow of the argument. Many apparently well known cases are revisited and critically assessed to draw clear and often contrary to popular belief lessons. This is a highly original and commendable feature of this text. It provides an unusually strong integration between theory and examples. And there is no doubt of the relevance of the examples: they are not inserted as an afterthought, but are intrinsically part of the development of the thinking\u0027 - Professor James Fleck, Head of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Group, University of Edinburgh Management School This book analyses a range of social contexts in which human decisions shape technology in the market economy. It comprises a critical review of both a select research literature and in-depth historical studies. Material is drawn from many social science disciplines to inform the reader of the reality of taking decisions on innovation. The chapters cover: - The social context for individual acts of creative insight - The development of the technology-market relationship - The management of R\u0026D and technological standards - Technological competition - The role of institutions of finance in innovation - The reciprocal relationship between intellectual property law and technological innovation. - The role of technological skills and regimes of technological education in innovation. - An introduction to the role of the state in maintaining the innovative capacity of the private sector.",

    "subtitle": "Toward a Humanistic Philosophy",
    "description": "A great fissure occurred in Western civilization in the early modern period with the divorce between the humanities and the sciences and the rise of scientific naturalism. The Metaphysics of Self and World is a philosophical exploration of the relationship between the individual, the culture, and the world. It is, in the author\u0027s words, \"a philosophy of the humanities, a philosophy of humanity, and a philosophy of social reality.\" It explores the implications of a world-view that would integrate the perspective of the sciences with humanistic ways of thought. E.M. Adams claims that we do violence to ourselves as human beings by trying to fit into the world as delineated in scientific categories. Rejecting cultural subjectivism and scientific naturalism, he argues for the irreducibility and validity of the categories of the humanities and for a fully developed humanistic philosophy of self and world. In generating this world-view, he utilizes the humanities as a source of culture therapy in order to close the fissure in Western civilization. Author note: E. M. Adams is Kenan Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has written numerous books and articles, and a festschrift celebrating his work, Mind, Value, and Culture: Essays in Honor of E. M. Adams (edited by David Weissbord), was published in 1989.",

    "description": "This collection of essays and interviews highlights the modern movement of ‘philosophical practice’. Taking their cue and call from Socrates’ summons to ‘know thyself’, contemporary philosophical counsellors and practitioners have returned to the ancient understanding of philosophy as consolation and contemplation, as a life directed to the loving search for wisdom and clarity. Socrates and the Stoics continued this tradition, seeing philosophy primarily as a practical way of living in alignment with oneself and the logos. Thus interpreted, philosophy is a path, teaches a method more than pronounces a thesis, and issues a living praxis devoted to daily spiritual exercises whose aim is nothing less than the transformation of the self – a metamorphosis of the personality. This conception of philosophy’s essence was lost, but was later retrieved by certain philosophers, such as Viktor Frankl and Ludwig Wittgenstein, in the twentieth-century, who have unleashed and uncovered philosophy’s original therapeutic impulse and intent. As such, this book will prove of inestimable value to philosophers, psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, counsellors, clients, and students of these disciplines.",

    "description": "Why are some countries better than others at science and technology (S\u0026T)? Written in an approachable style, The Politics of Innovation provides readers from all backgrounds and levels of expertise a comprehensive introduction to the debates over national S\u0026T competitiveness. It synthesizes over fifty years of theory and research on national innovation rates, bringing together the current political and economic wisdom, and latest findings, about how nations become S\u0026T leaders. Many experts mistakenly believe that domestic institutions and policies determine national innovation rates. However, after decades of research, there is still no agreement on precisely how this happens, exactly which institutions matter, and little aggregate evidence has been produced to support any particular explanation. Yet, despite these problems, a core faith in a relationship between domestic institutions and national innovation rates remains widely held and little challenged. The Politics of Innovation confronts head-on this contradiction between theory, evidence, and the popularity of the institutions-innovation hypothesis. It presents extensive evidence to show that domestic institutions and policies do not determine innovation rates. Instead, it argues that social networks are as important as institutions in determining national innovation rates. The Politics of Innovation also introduces a new theory of \"creative insecurity\" which explains how institutions, policies, and networks are all subservient to politics. It argues that, ultimately, each country\u0027s balance of domestic rivalries vs. external threats, and the ensuing political fights, are what drive S\u0026T competitiveness. In making its case, The Politics of Innovation draws upon statistical analysis and comparative case studies of the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Russia and a dozen countries across Western Europe.",

    "description": "The Problems of Philosophy (1912) is one of Bertrand Russell\u0027s attempts to create a brief and accessible guide to the problems of philosophy. Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics: If it is uncertain that external objects exist, how can we then have knowledge of them but by probability. There is no reason to doubt the existence of external objects simply because of sense data.Russell guides the reader through his famous 1910 distinction between \"knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description\" and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, René Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.\" In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.\"",

    "title": "The Rise of Scientific Philosophy",
    "subtitle": null,
    "description": "This book represents a new approach to philosophy. It treats philosophy as not a collection of systems, but as a study of problems. It recognizes in traditional philosophical systems the historical function of having asked questions rather than having given solutions. Professor Reichenbach traces the failures of the systems to psychological causes. Speculative philosophers offered answers at a time when science had not yet provided the means to give true answers. Their search for certainty and for moral directives led them to accept pseudo-solutions. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and many others are cited to illustrate the rationalist fallacy: reason, unaided by observation, was regarded as a source of knowledge, revealing the physical world and \"moral truth.\" The empiricists could not disprove this thesis, for they could not give a valid account of mathematical knowledge. Mathematical discoveries in the early nineteenth century cleared the way for modern scientific philosophy. Its advance was furthered by discoveries in modern physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. These findings have made possible a new conception of the universe and of the atom. The work of scientists thus altered philosophy completely and brought into being a philosopher with a new attitude and training. Instead of dictating so-called laws of reason to the scientist, this modern philosopher proceeds by analyzing scientific methods and results. He finds answers to the age-old questions of space, time, causality, and life; of the human observer and the external world. He tells us how to find our way through this world without resorting to unjustifiable beliefs or assuming a supernatural origin for moral standards. Philosophy thus is no longer a battleground of contradictory opinions, but a science discovering truth step by step. Professor Reichenbach, known for his many contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, addresses this book to a wider audience. He writes for those who do not have the leisure or preparation to read in the fields of mathematics, symbolic logic, or physics. Besides showing the principal foundations of the new philosophy, he has been careful to provide the necessary factual background. He has written a philosophical study, not a mere popularization. It contains within its chapters all the necessary scientific material in an understandable form—and, therefore, conveys all the information indispensable to a modern world-view. The late Hans Reichenbach was Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles. His previous books include",

They split history into ages - electrification, motorisation, and computerisation - and rarely ask whether anyone bothered to use these inventions at the time. Shock of the Old is not one of those histories. I Letters exist alongside emails and outlasted telegrams; we still make physical books and magazines despite the rise of the Internet - a belated rise considering that the technologies that made it possible was invented in 1965, and bookshops thrive despite Amazon. More horses were used in the Second World War than any other war in history and propeller planes continue to take off from the same runways as jets. Shock of the Old forces us to reassess the significance of old inventions such as corrugated iron and sewing machines and rethink the relative importance we place on the invention of something new, its application, and its widespread adoption. It challenges the idea that we live in an era of ever increasing change and, interweaving political, economic and cultural history, teaches us to think critically about technology.",

    "subtitle": "Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem",
    "description": "The Way Forward for Entrepreneurship Around the World We are in the midst of a startup revolution. The growth and proliferation of innovation-driven startup activity is profound, unprecedented, and global in scope. Today, it is understood that communities of support and knowledge-sharing go along with other resources. The importance of collaboration and a long-term commitment has gained wider acceptance. These principles are adopted in many startup communities throughout the world. And yet, much more work is needed. Startup activity is highly concentrated in large cities. Governments and other actors such as large corporations and universities are not collaborating with each other nor with entrepreneurs as well as they could. Too often, these actors try to control activity or impose their view from the top-down, rather than supporting an environment that is led from the bottom-up. We continue to see a disconnect between an entrepreneurial mindset and that of many actors who wish to engage with and support entrepreneurship. There are structural reasons for this, but we can overcome many of these obstacles with appropriate focus and sustained practice. No one tells this story better than Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway. The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem explores what makes startup communities thrive and how to improve collaboration in these rapidly evolving, complex environments. The Startup Community Way is an explanatory guide for startup communities. Rooted in the theory of complex systems, this book establishes the systemic properties of entrepreneurial ecosystems and explains why their complex nature leads people to make predictable mistakes. As complex systems, value creation occurs in startup communities primarily through the interaction of the \"parts\" - the people, organizations, resources, and conditions involved - not the parts themselves. This continual process of bottom-up interactions unfolds naturally, producing value in novel and unexpected ways. Through these complex, emergent processes, the whole becomes greater and substantially different than what the parts alone could produce. Because of this, participants must take a fundamentally different approach than is common in much of our civic and professional lives. Participants must take a whole-system view, rather than simply trying to optimize their individual part. They must prioritize experimentation and learning over planning and execution. Complex systems are uncertain and unpredictable. They cannot be controlled, only guided and influenced. Each startup community is unique. Replication is enticing but impossible. The race to become \"The Next Silicon Valley\" is futile - even Silicon Valley couldn\u0027t recreate itself. This book: Offers practical advice for entrepreneurs, community builders, government officials, and other stakeholders who want to harness the power of entrepreneurship in their city Describes the core components of startup communities and entrepreneurial ecosystems, as well as an explanation of the differences between these two related, but distinct concepts Advances a new framework for effective startup community building based on the theory of complex systems and insights from systems thinking Includes contributions from leading entrepreneurial voices Is a must-have resource for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, executives, business and community leaders, economic development authorities, policymakers, university officials, and anyone wishing to understand how startup communities work anywhere in the world",

The first run printing of The Startup Playbook SOLD OUT! So, we revised, expanded, and improved this second edition, including a new foreword by Brad Feld, author of Venture Deals. We still give our personal, how-to guide for building your startup from the ground up. You\u0027ll find a collection of the major lessons and shortcuts we\u0027ve learned that will shift the odds in your favor. We\u0027re sharing our tips, secrets, and advice in a frank, founder-to-founder discussion with you. We make no bones about our bias. We\u0027re on your side, the founder\u0027s side. While venture capitalists, investors, and accelerators/incubators can add great value in the startup ecosystem, this book isn\u0027t about their points of view. We\u0027ll tell you where our interests as founders diverge from those on the other side of the table—investors, bankers, advisors, board members, and others—and what to do when that happens. The Startup Playbook is not a recipe, it\u0027s not a template, it\u0027s not a list of tasks to do. It\u0027s our insider\u0027s guide to starting a company and running it successfully in those critical early months. Between us, we\u0027ve started over a dozen high-tech software companies and raised over $500 million in investment capital. We\u0027ve acquired over thirty-five companies, had three of our startups go public, sold six of them, and we made billions of dollars for shareholders. We\u0027ve also invested in over eighty startups, advised and mentored over two hundred companies and actively worked with venture capitalists (VCs), incubators, and accelerators to help launch many other new startups. We\u0027ve had plenty of failures, too. And we\u0027ve probably learned more from those than from the successes. We share those lessons as well. The Startup Playbook is full of our advice, guidance, do\u0027s, and don\u0027ts from our years of experience as founders many times. We want to share our hard-earned knowledge with you to make success easier for you to achieve. \"This book is extraordinarily fresh and exciting. In an accessible, straight talk fashion, this book is a manual, and an inspiration. The Startup Playbook is smart and avoids the \u0027I am so smart\u0027 over-writing endemic to the genre. Read this as it is presented. You\u0027ll be doing yourself a tremendous favor.\" —Amazon Reviewer",

    "description": "Startups are Changing The World Everyday! South Africa, Africa and the World find themselves in the most important period of the new economic revolution, the strongest and biggest one so far. It is the revolution leading us from the post-industrial era into the knowledge-based society. According to economic experts, the future will bring a divide between countries that will know how to answer challenges of a knowledge-based society, and countries in which the economic and social lag will become increasingly larger. The Startup Recipe is a guide for young Startup Creators. In the Book, Sandile Shabangu discusses morden techniques and tools to help young people launch successful startups drawing from global trends. The book also includes The Startup Mzansi Blueprint which discusses key challenges and possibilities for building a globally competitive startup ecosystem in South Africa. \"Instead of trying to change the world through revolution, we can change the world through innovation\"",

    "description": "Is a widening “skills gap” in science and math education threatening America’s future? That is the seminal question addressed in The U.S. Technology Skills Gap, a comprehensive 104-year review of math and science education in America. Some claim this “skills gap” is “equivalent to a permanent national recession” while others cite how the gap threatens America’s future economic, workforce employability and national security. This much is sure: America’s math and science skills gap is, or should be, an issue of concern for every business and information technology executive in the United States and The U.S Technology Skills Gap is the how-to-get involved guidebook for those executives laying out in a compelling chronologic format: The history of the science and math skills gap in America Explanation of why decades of astute warnings were ignored Inspiring examples of private company efforts to supplement public education A pragmatic 10-step action plan designed to solve the problem And a tantalizing theory of an obscure Japanese physicist that suggests America’s days as the global scientific leader are numbered Engaging and indispensable, The U.S. Technology Skills Gap is essential reading for those eager to see America remain a relevant global power in innovation and invention in the years ahead.",

    "description": "Philosophy is the quest for a life that is fully alive. Drawing on the insights of philosophers through the ages, The Way of Philosophy clarifies what it means to live life intensely. It exposes the shallowness of conventional wisdom by asking such questions as -Can science know everything? -Should we do it if it feels good? -Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? -Is life about creating ourselves? -Is love supposed to be selfless? -Can we ignore death? -If God exists, why is he hiding? Philosophers invite us to go down deep and live a life in light of truth, goodness, and beauty. If we tread this path, we can discover for ourselves the hidden source of the philosophical life in the unending wellspring of wonder. \"\"This work is a call to wonder! Professor Engelland has reflected deeply on the questions that move the human heart--love, beauty, goodness, truth. These pages thus serve as a form of spiritual exercise for thinkers, aiming to arouse us from our various levels of psychic torpor and to bring us to see the marvels of existence at all levels.\"\" --David Meconi, Professor of Theology, Saint Louis University; Editor, Homiletic and Pastoral Review \"\"This is a beautiful little introduction to philosophy, which, with its humor, provocative observations, and clever anecdotes and examples, will draw students in before they know what\u0027s happening. Engelland does a marvelous job of speaking plainly and directly to students without diluting philosophical content, and of opening up classical themes in a fresh and unpretentious way.\"\" --D. C. Schindler, Associate Professor of Anthropology and Metaphysics, John Paul II Institute; author of The Perfection of Freedom and The Critique of Impure Reason Chad Engelland is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Dallas in Irving, Texas.

    "subtitle": "A New Paradigm of Growth",
    "description": "The current economic theory of innovation mainly analyses the technology factor and its impact on economic growth. In today\u0027s world, growth in information technology and knowledge of new ideas has altered the business paradigm dramatically. Modern economies have undergone a dynamic shift from material manufacturing to a new information technology model with research and development (R\u0026D) and human capital. Through information and communications technology efficient information usage has achieved substantial productivity gains through learning by doing and incremental innovations. The present volume discusses this new paradigm in terms of both theory and industry applications, including Schumpeter in his innovation model and the emphasis on new innovations replacing the old. Growth of business networking and R\u0026D consortium have dramatically helped the modern business to reduce their unit costs and improve efficiency. This volume presents some new models emphasizing knowledge sharing and R\u0026D cooperation. Rapid growth in recent times in some south Asian countries have been cited as growth miracles are largely caused by knowledge spillover and learning by doing, and this volume also investigates the role of incremental innovations. With a strong focus and extension of the current theory of innovation and industry growth experiences of both the US and Asian countries, this book will be of interest to MBA and graduate students in economics, innovation management, and applied industrial economics.",

    "title": "Thinking About Starting a Business?",
    "subtitle": "A Guide on How to Start Your Own Business",
    "description": "Why should you go to the trouble of creating a written business plan? There are three major reasons: The process of putting a business plan together, including the thought you put in before beginning to write it, forces you to take an objective, critical unemotional look at your business project in its entirety. The finished product your business plan is and operating told which, properly used, will help you manage your business and work toward its success. The completed business plan is the means for communicating your ideas to others and provide the basis for your financing proposal. The importance of planning cannot be overemphasized. By taking an objective look at your business you can identify areas of weakness and strengths, pinpoint needs you might otherwise overlook, spot problems before they arise, and begin planning how you can best achieve your business goals. As an operating tool, your business plan helps you to establish reasonable objectives and figure out how to best accomplish them. It also helps you to red-flag problems as they arise and aids you to identifying their sources, thus suggesting ways to solve them. It may even help you avoid some problems altogether. This handbook has been designed with these considerations in mind. In order for it to work it is important that you do as much of the work as possible. A professionally prepared business plan wont do you any good if you dont understand it thoroughly. This understanding comes from being involved with its development from the very start. No business plan, no matter how carefully constructed and no matter how thoroughly understood, will be of any use at all unless you use it. Going into business is rough; over half of all new businesses fail within the first two years of operation and over 90 percent fail within the first 10 years. A major reason for failure is lack of planning. The best way to enhance your chances of success is to plan and follow through on your planning. Use your plan. Dont put it in the bottom drawer of your desk and forget it. Your business plan can help you avoid going into a business venture that is doomed to failure. If your proposed venture is marginal at best, the business plan will show you why and may help you avoid paying the high tuition of business failure. It is far cheaper not to begin an ill-fated business than to learn by experience what your business plan could have taught you at several hours of concentrated work. Finally, your business plan provides the information needed by others to evaluate your venture, especially if you need to seek outside financing. A thorough business automatically becomes a complete financing proposal which will meet the requirements of most lenders.",

    "subtitle": "What Kind of Conversation is Philosophy?",
    "description": "Thinking about Thinking examines philosophy from a variety of perspectives as a the practice realized by persons who communicate with one another while reflecting about the meaning of human life and thought. Without forgetting the logical and methodological conditions of systematic thought, the author insists on the intimate connections that tie all philosophical texts and conversations to the lives from which they emerge. As product of an individual thinker, who, thanks to individual teachers, has been familiarized with particular traditions of a particular culture, each philosophy is unique. If it is a good one, it is also revealing for many--perhaps even for all--other philosophers. At the same time, all thinking is addressed to individual interlocutors, each of whom responds to it by transforming it into a different philosophy. This fact invites us to explore the dialogical dimension of thinking, which, in turn, refers us to the communitarian and historical contexts from which solitude, as well as solidarity, competition, alliances, and friendships in thought emerge. After the collapse of modern autonomy, the question of philosophy\u0027s dependence on prephilosophical conditions is a basic question of metaphilosophy -- especially if a philosophy is always entangled with or even rooted in some belief or trust or faith.",

With a track record of starting companies from scratch, raising both angel and venture capital, and participating in eight exits as founder, operator, and board member, Parker\u0027s experience is practical and actionable. Having sold three of his own startups and closed two, Parker learned just as much from his failures as from his successes, and he brings this wit and wisdom into his writing in a transparent way. Parker shares advice on: • What makes a good idea that makes money • Recruiting and working with cofounders • Asking customers what product they want (customer development) • How to build a tech product even as a non-tech founder • How to get out of your head, ship a product, and make your first sale Trajectory: Startup removes the mystery from the startup process and outlines a roadmap of tasks and timeframes, with monthly milestones and resources.

    "title": "Which Factors Determine the Success or Failure of Startup Companies? A Startup Ecosystem Analysis of Hungary, Germany and the US",
    "subtitle": null,
    "description": "As more and more startup companies are founded every year worldwide, building up one’s own business does not get easier. Since 9 out of 10 startups fail, future entrepreneurs are well advised to take a look at potential reasons for failure and success. Learning from others’ mistakes and studying success stories can improve their own performance and help to avoid critical errors. The academic paper at hand will provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs. It not only states the most important terms concerning startups but also lists the most important factors for a startup company’s success, according to literature review. Delineating both internal and external factors, this thesis not only delivers a synoptic view of potential challenges inside a startup as well as in its ecosystem, but also juxtaposes these influences in opposition. The second part of this paper analyzes a series of interviews with twelve startup founders from three different regions (the province of North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany, Budapest in Hungary and the state of California in the US). Their views and experiences will be summarized and put into the context of their respective startup ecosystem.",

    "subtitle": "Armenia\u0027s Role in the Present War",
    "description": "Armenia has become a touchstone of victory in the great war for freedom and humanity. If Armenia is granted national independence it will mean that in the making of the peace treaty the forces of democracy and human progress have triumphed over the forces of imperialism and short-sighted reaction. It will mean that in the future the rights of the small nations are to be recognized as well as those of the great. It will mean that international justice is to be the foundation of the new world order. The triumph of the principle that is involved will mean that the war has been won because its moral aims have been achieved. But if the Armenians were to be thrust back under the yoke of Turkey, it would mean that injustice, massacre and atrocity are to be permanent features of the world of the future. It would mean that the justice-loving nations of the world will prepare for inevitable conflicts that are to come. It would mean that the war which was fought to end war has been lost. National independence for Armenia will mean that the old order of secret intrigue and orthodox diplomacy has given way to a new order of open democratic diplomacy, based on the self-determination of nations and the principles of international justice. It will mean that the peace which ends this war will be a democratic peace, a peace of the peoples, a peace that will last. It will mean that imperialistic aims, secret treaties and selfish greedy interests have given way before the conception of a world organized for righteousness and permanent peace. National independence for Armenia will mean that the Balance of Power, which has always considered the subject nations of Turkey as mere pawns in a diplomatic game, has been replaced by a League of Free Nations opening the way towards a world federation and the parliament of man.",

    "subtitle": "Italy and Early Modern Europe",
    "description": "This book sheds light on the originality and historical significance of women’s philosophical, moral, political and scientific ideas in Italy and early modern Europe. Divided into three sections, it starts by discussing the women philosophers’ engagement with the classical inheritance with regard to the works of Moderata Fonte, Tullia d\u0027Aragona and Anne Conway. The next section examines the relationship between women philosophers and the new philosophy of nature, focusing on the connections between female thought and the new seventeenth- and eighteenth-century science, and discussing the work of Camilla Erculiani, Margherita Sarocchi, Margaret Cavendish, Mariangela Ardinghelli, Teresa Ciceri, Candida Lena Perpenti, and Alessandro Volta. The final section presents male philosophers’ perspectives on the role of women, discussing the place of women in the work of Giordano Bruno, Poulain de la Barre and the theories of Hobbes and Rawls. By exploring these women philosophers, writers and translators, the book offers a re-examination of the early modern thinking of and about women in Italy.",
